A family member‚Äôs 2017 Honda has a knob for volume. **Miles** better. But the volume on the steering wheel is a capacitive slider. Guess what? Driver constantly adjusts the volume accidentally. 

Modern Hondas don‚Äôt have capacitive junk on the wheel. 

Customers constantly complain about this. VW went all capacitive on the ID.4 and I heard they were fixing that for a future version, at least on the wheel.

My point is: none of this is new. How have they not learned yet? Why is this still happening? Yes I want a big screen. I love it. My Mach-E has a huge screen it‚Äôs great. 

You know what I want? A handful of buttons for common climate control stuff. That + wheel controls are enough for me 99% of the time. Let the touchscreen do the rest.

There's another upside: touchscreens are cheaper.

Maybe more expensive than a single button, but creating a multitude of buttons, testing them, labelling, removing them for certain trims, changing them for different markets, recasting and repositioning them for LHD/RHD - a big screen gets rid of all that, and makes the cars a lot cheaper for the manufacturer.

I agree with this. I think these price decreases are going to hit the Mustang Mach E, EV6, and Ioniq 5 most of all.

Heck, I honestly wouldn't be surprised if Hyundai Motor Group just kind of nopes out of the ""premium EV"" market until they have US production online and can use the tax credit, and only offers enough of the Ioniq 5 and EV6 for compliance. I think the Niro and Kona EVs will be fine though.

Carburetion, ignition, and combustion chamber designs were not good, so they were pretty stinky from unburned fuel. Traveling at city speeds you were probably getting about 18 mpg. Gas was the equivalent of $4-5 gallon but was much worse quality, often containing water or other contaminants - it's one of the reasons those old fuel pumps had a glass top. Maintenance intervals on some parts were intense. The Model T had some items that needed checking every 50 miles and maintenance every 200 miles. The first electric starter wasn't until 1912.

Your 2019 car could do that circuit *most of the time*. It most definitely could not do it without you sitting in the driver's seat, actively watching for mistakes. If you sat in your car today and ran that circuit, you would not be sitting there ""only for legal reasons"".

It's important to recognize here that the issue isn't whether the demonstration itself was possible. Demonstrably, it was *possible*. The issue is the misrepresentation of how reliable and mature the technology was. Statements that the driver was not ""doing anything"" and was ""only there for legal reasons"" were categorically false.

The extended range only trims got the biggest cuts, followed by the Premium.

And this describes why Tesla still has the advantage over them:

&gt;In Ford‚Äôs case, the price cuts will mean **not all Mach-E models, based on the trim, will be profitable on a per-unit basis,** according to Marin Gjaja, chief customer officer of Ford‚Äôs electric vehicle business. He said Mach-E production is expected to increase from 78,000 vehicles to 130,000 units annually.  
&gt;  
&gt;‚ÄúWe are responding to changes in the marketplace,‚Äù Gjaja said during a media briefing, referencing new federal EV incentives and Tesla‚Äôs price cuts. ‚ÄúAs we look and want to stay competitive in the marketplace, we‚Äôre having to respond.‚Äù  
&gt;  
&gt;Ford expects to offset some of the profit shrink with cost improvements thanks to the additional production as well as a reduction in some commodity costs, according to Gjaja. The Mach-E‚Äôs starting price will now range from about $46,000 to $64,000. Tesla‚Äôs Model Y starts at about $53,500 to $57,000, without any options.

They are strategic moves, modern day weapons being deployed in a globalization war that is brewing specifically to make the US strong in the face of China. When that's the real goal, of course you don't want to phase things out. You want to act now, and be strong.

Fact is, the US has been sitting on its laurels for decades when it comes to at home manufacturing, R&amp;D, and how much free trade is allowed to happen through it to other countries. This has up until recently largely been a good thing. It could afford to do this because they were still on top when it comes to running the modern world, especially if it meant the dirty work of outsourcing labor could be done peacefully by other people. Globalization has been greatly beneficial to the US overall.

However, China has dramatically caught up thanks to this deep level of reliance on them and they do not have good motives. Not only do they control a huge supply of world's rare earth metals, but through US's lack of control over their own supply chain China has managed to develop key computer chips that control missiles/weapons/technologies that the US thought they had a firm grip on, all running on American made software. What was once a supply chain &amp; technological advantage that the US was clearly on top of, is now being challenged by China.

All of this is to say, we're now in a sort of ""cold war"" with China and we're not going to easily play ball with them if we can help it. If china becomes the top dog on this bargaining table, then they will now have the power &amp; influence to do things such as being able to afford to cut off the US entirely, or invade taiwan, or brush of sanctions. Basically free reign to do things the US really doesn't want china to do. These moves are direct, strong actions to force companies to play ball with the US and not to China, helping ensure that the US still controls the bargaining chips while also helping the US be strong in a more china-isolated future.

And all of this isn't even getting into the fact that the pandemic really showed how fragile our supply chains really are. A lot of this is to ensure that supply chain disruptions... however they might happen in the future (blockaid, war, etc) don't ruin the US's ability to still compete and be economically strong.

It was sold as addressing climate change, but as far as making progress replacing ICE vehicles with EVs it seems like a step forward and a step back, leaving us about where we were.  Tesla and GM get subsidies again, but Kia and Hyundai lose theirs.

If you view it in terms of being good for the American auto industry and bad for foreign competition, then yeah, the IRA is effective.  It creates a subsidy moat that makes foreign vehicles uncompetitive.  American automakers can sell their cars for higher prices, and still be cheaper than foreign vehicles.  Tesla and GM shareholders should be pleased.

Is this actually good for consumers?  I think no.  It's basically the chicken tax, but for EVs.  In the U.S., the whole light truck category has basically ceased to exist.  Why is that?  Domestic manufacturers don't want to make them (and if they did, they'd have to contend with very strict fuel economy standards that are hard to meet), and imports are smacked down with a 25% tariff that's been in place since 1964.

Domestic automakers like selling big trucks.  They're profitable.  If light trucks were available, a lot of people might choose them instead, but fortunately for the automakers, the current regulatory environment prevents those vehicles from being sold here.  This is bad for everyone except the car companies that love those big trucks and have gaslit Americans into thinking they must all love big trucks too.

I don't want the same thing to happen in the EV world too.  If, say, some Korean or Japanese company makes a small, cheap EV that meets people's actual needs better than an obese American crossover EV, then I want them to be able to sell it on the U.S. market on equal footing.

I might even go so far as saying Chinese vehicles should have equal access to our markets (assuming they meet the safety requirements).

My mistake is that I used to think that I could live with an inferior charging network because I would be doing 95% of my charging at home anyways, so it just wouldn't matter that much.... And then I took a trip and realized how much it did matter.  Even though I only take a couple long trips a year, nothing ruins a trip more than the shitty experience of fast charging on a CCS network that's always broken.

Since picking up a model S, I've taken one long trip and it was an absolute breeze.  The experience was not even close.  Everything from availability of chargers to charger locations to charging speeds, plug and play, and even the handling the Tesla connector (as opposed to the comically big and clunky CCS connector) was better.  Shit, the ease of not fumbling through the dozen different CCS apps, registering, adding a credit card, etc, etc was worth it alone.

I think the mainstream manufacturers all REALLY dropped the ball here and while not impossible to recover, I don't think it'll be easy.

*Just a quick note on why I think so damn many of those CCS chargers break so often.... Screens.  CCS chargers almost always have digital touchscreens for payments or monitoring and when those screens are exposed to the elements (sun, rain, snow, wind, cold, etc..) they're bound to cause problems.  The simplicity of Tesla's chargers are part of their beauty.  No screens.  No big, stupid ""start/stop"" buttons.  Simpler, easy to handle connectors.",20

EDIT: Having said that...
I have watched numerous Lightning, MachE, Rivian, and Ioniq owners suffer at the same chargers. Rivian owners are shooting 100% failure at the location I park next to (because they didn't register the car and EVGo app). This particular location is only 3 months old.  I park in a lot 6 days a week with EVgo chargers while I wait for my kids to get out of thier evening activities, Generally sitting there at least 2 hours a day over a few trips. So I get to see all sorts of EVS roll in. In nearly every case they are people who have just rolled up and want to charge like a gas pump and just swipe a credit card (as it should be right?). They haven't activated the apps, or registered the plug and charge.   I have found myself having to walk through how to enable the apps and charging at least 60 times over the last 4 months. Tell them about Plug Share etc. Watching people freaking out at the chargers makes me feel like I should help. I'm in my Mach E usually transcibing bass lines for Reddit Users using my phone or Youtube (now yay!). so sometimes they approach me.

That the other EVs makers won't adopt NACS should'nt matter as long as the 3rd party charging networks use the funding to build dual cable CCS/NACS 'fuel pumps'. Tesla as the market leader (64% of the North America EV market) should get at least $2 billion to built NACS with the Magic Dock.

9,2023-02-09,"Untrue.  EA is a legal mandate over dieselgate.

The auto manufacturers are purposely holding EVs back.  Tesla knew from day one that you cannot sell EVs without chargers and built them in tandem. Right now, not one legacy auto company is investing in any chargers. not even VW.  VW is the reason working chargers is not a priority for EA because VW still controls EA, despite it being a legal mandate in a settlement.

If dieselgate never happened, CCS charging above 50kw wouldn't exist at all.

I cannot wait until a legacy company figures this out and actually invests in chargers at the scale of tesla.  I would expect them to switch to NACS too because it has better usability for the consumer and doesn't have the pin separation issues CCS has experienced on EA's network due to the heft of the connector.  Customers also don't want to use CCS tips over NACS tips once they experienced both.

At any time, EA could swap the 2nd CCS cable on all their chargers to NACS. The whole point of supporting two cables was to support two different charging tips, EA put on two CCS cables to avoid hElPiNg TeSlA.  NACS can use any protocol, it is the same exact wires as CCS, but in a more compact arrangement.  Tesla cars have a universal charging circuit that supports any charging protocol globally.  The protocol of the charger does not matter.  A tesla can plug into a CCS charger with a NACS cable or a CCS cable with a NACS adapter and work just fine using the CCS protocol.  Other car manufacturers should be using similar universal charging circuits that they standardize for all their cars in all markets, it just makes sense to reduce cost.

NACS also supports up to 1000kw, CCS is only 350kw.  A new version of CCS coming out in 2025, only supports 500kw.  It still requires swapping out every charger which no one is going to do.  

The current upper charging speed limit on the tesla v4 chargers isn't even known publicly.  No one knows what tesla plans to do, but it is likely that the charging hardware all supports high wattages, even if they initially use smaller grid connections and offer around 300-350kw.  Upgrading the speed in the future will likely be an electrical service upgrade without changing the charger hardware out.",9

Payment methods must be accessible to persons with disabilities, not require a membership, not affect the power flow to vehicles, and provide access for those that are limited English proficient.

&gt; **Interoperability of EV Charging Infrastructure**

&gt;This final rule establishes certain interoperability requirements for charger-to-EV communication, charger-to-charger-network communication, and charging-network-to-charging network communication, as well as a requirement for chargers to be designed to securely switch charging network providers without any changes to hardware.

&gt; **Information on Publicly Available EV Charging Infrastructure Locations, Pricing, Real Time Availability, and Accessibility Through Mapping**

&gt; This final rule establishes requirements for information on publicly available EV charging infrastructure locations, pricing, real time availability, and accessibility through mapping. The regulations specify that these specific data fields that must be available, free of charge, to third party software developers. The regulation also specifies how the price for EV charging must be displayed and stipulates that the price must be the real-
time price and any other fees in addition to the price for electricity must be clearly displayed and explained. This final rule also establishes that each charging port must have an average annual uptime greater than 97 percent.",0

Although a few commenters preferred Tesla connectors, most of the Tesla products are proprietary and do not address the needs of the majority of EV makes and models available in the domestic market. However, on November 11, 2022, Tesla announced its ‚ÄúNorth American Charging Standard‚Äù (NACS), which makes its existing and previously proprietary Electric Vehicle charging port and connector available for broad and open public use, including to network operators and vehicle manufacturers. In the announcement, Tesla noted that charging providers were planning to offer NACS charging ports at public charging infrastructure. **This rulemaking allows permanently attached non-proprietary connectors (such as NACS) to be provided on each charging port so long as each DCFC charging port has at least one permanently attached CCS Type 1 connector and is capable of charging a CCS-compliant vehicle.**",0

9,2023-02-16,"&gt; Tesla was willing to license it but simply would not participate in an engineering-by-committee approach.

Tesla wasn't willing to license their design, this was evident by the conditions they placed on their ""offer"" to license their design. They were offering the designs for charging in return for access to all the licensee's patents. That's like me selling peanut butter for a thousand dollars a gram and claiming that the lack of sales is due to the lack of demand for peanut butter.

Tesla is part of the engineering-by-committee standards for vehicle charging. They produced the Tesla charging connector because the CCS standard was far too far away from being ratified, and the Tesla Mennekes-based connector  (basically Type 2 but with HVDC available on the same pins) was another attempt at getting something out into the field that would work while the standards body was dithering about.

Now Tesla is offering the NACS standard but it's only the connector not the entire supercharging experience. Too little too late.

We already have the defined standard for ""Plug and Charge"" and we have various short-cut attempts such as registering the vehicle's charging certificate to allow existing EVSE to simply start charging when a vehicle associated with a financial member is plugged in.

There's a lot of evolution that's going to happen down the line, and whatever ends up being CCS3 is going to have a lot of real world experience baked into it. My guess is that the charging standard we move to in ten years is going to be more like USB Power Delivery for megawatt scale systems than what CCS is today.",0

Especially at highway speeds, Aero makes a much bigger difference than weight. And the buzz has a much bigger frontal area, and zero slope to the back. It's simply not built for Aero as you can't really do that in a van.

I'd be interested to see how they compare at low speeds though. In stop and go traffic it's not about the external shape, but purely about how efficient the motors are, and how the acceleration and regen curves are designed.

Their really big hurdle in europe is that they're competing with a lot of other vans with similar specs and much lower prices like the kangoo and the rifter. Though they get shorter ranges but most people don't need the range in a minivan, they need to drop the kids 20 minutes away.",0

There is only the one bad report in the last few days, (perhaps that is yours).    


I am skeptical whether negative reports work that well or not, but I'd like to think they do somewhat.  The fact that plugshare lists it as under repair is not the last word on whether negative reports should be left there.  EA apparently really dropped the ball so badly on this one that they should not (IMO) get a pass on the amount of time it will take them to get this back up.  Furthermore, there is at least one other report in this topic that this particular station is down a lot.  Multiple negative reports serve to drive down the score and warn other drivers.

I don't love everything about Tesla, but in my view Tesla would likely repair such a key station location very quickly, as they seem to be, over the years, far more motivated to help drivers avoid having these sorts of difficulties.  Still, on at least one occasion I've had enough of an issue with a Tesla supercharger to leave a negative review.  I think there's too much ""grade inflation"" that goes on.

Tesla has created a whole infrastructure. An almost completely in-house designed and built car, worldwide charging system, battery storage (for transportation and grid storage), etc

Other car companies outsource everything. They basically badge a car that‚Äôs been constructed by a ton of other manufacturers. They have never cared about the refueling infrastructure because that‚Äôs not what they historically did. Some improvements to cars are because a downstream manufacturer improved a system and sometimes it happens because there‚Äôs a problem that they‚Äôre required to fix by some government. This is why the rate of change is so slow - coordinating change between hundreds of entities is complicated and doesn‚Äôt lend itself to revolutionary change, only very slow evolutionary change.

If people have problems fueling at one location, they'll immediately go somewhere else to fill up (and buy a coke, hot dog, snacks, smokes, etc.). And that immediately affects the business's bottom line. 

With EA (and other charging networks), though, that sort of immediacy/urgency doesn't exist. I think they don't make that much profit (if any) from the individuals stopping to charge every day. I think most of the incoming funds come from places like government grants, subscriptions, partnership deals with EV manufacturers, and stuff like that. Stuff that isn't immediately dependent on whether or not a given charging station is working on a given day.  
  
Tesla would be the exception, of course. But the supercharger network is a huge part of their brand identity and perceived value.

The only way out of this mess is for the manufacturers to contribute to a third party set up to run charging, and each manufacturer gets control of that organization proportionate to their investment. The third party watches what infrastructure is and isn't reliable,  watches where lines are long or there are gaps in coverage, and installs accordingly.

Kidding aside, while I get the frustration, why are you connecting ""Electrify America"" with EV growth?

We don't have 275,000,000 gas cars in the USA because just Exxon was successful. We have dozens of competitive gas stations and convenience store brands to choose from. 

We need a robust nationwide charging infrastructure made up of a variety of healthy competitors. Not just put all of our eggs in one dieselgate settlement basket! If the EA station is broken, go use EVGo or ChargePoint. (Yes, I realize that's not an option in every area, but if that's the case in your area *that's* the problem that actually needs addressing more than EA's reliability! How is your state spending its discretionary Dieselgate funds? What is your state's NEVI plan? Where are all of the chargers your state was given funding to subsidize?)

I've done several 1000+ mile EV road trips. My first was in a Nissan Leaf, where I attempted (but failed!) to make the trip without using EA at all (as a middle finger to EA for its accelerated depreciation of Chademo.) If an EA station was broken (with the Leaf there's only one Chademo charger available regardless of how many working chargers there are) I just used a different charger (sadly the one time that happened the closest charger was also an EA!)

Of course I was fortunate to be in an area with adequate infrastructure, I realize not everyone is. You can't swing an extension cord without hitting a charger on I-70 through Colorado. And Utah, with a little less infrastructure than Colorado, operates a few free DC chargers along the highway courtesy their Dept of Transportation.

But again, this isn't an ""EA""  problem. This is a ""some states not giving enough a sh!t to do their job"" problem.

Yet, the author of the post states they won't do it again and take their ICE the next time.

It was literally impossible to travel using CCS in those areas at the time. EA in the last 5 years has opened up all those areas to travel with CCS vehicles.

&gt;Truck drivers use their trucks very much like other car owners: for commuting to and from work, presumably alone. The thing that most distinguishes truck owners from those of other vehicles is their sheer love of driving. ‚ÄúThe highest indexed use among truck owners is pleasure driving,‚Äù says Edwards. Truck drivers use their vehicles this way fully twice as often as the industry average. ‚ÄúThis is the freedom that trucks offer,‚Äù says Edwards.

&gt;This freedom isn‚Äôt exactly free.

&gt;Vehicle purchases are, at heart, irrational. Trucks are tough and fun and capable, and people dig being associated with that, in the same way that they seem to enjoy dressing up like their favorite sports stars and watching games, or putting on cowboy clothes on Halloween. I like to say that All Cars Are Drag, costumes that we put on and take off. And nowhere is this more relevant than with the Butch Drag offered by pickups. 

&gt;‚ÄúWhen asked for attributes that are important to them,‚Äù Edwards says, ‚Äútruck owners oversample in ones like: the ability to outperform others, to look good while driving, to present a tough image, to have their car act as extension of their personality, and to stand out in a crowd.‚Äù Trucks deliver on all of that. At a price.

As I said already, it's not that nobody should have a truck, it's that understanding what you actually need out of your transportation will allow you to make a more informed vehicle purchase and pick a vehicle potentially more suited to your exact situation.

For example:

I have a friend that frequently (like multiple times a month) hauls large furniture and tows cars on a flatbed trailer. I think we can both agree that his truck is probably the best form of vehicle for him.

I do NOT haul large furniture, but I do tow small trailers (3,000 lbs or less) every few months. I also don't have a budget that extends to $50K+ for a Lightning. For me, my Chevy Bolt is probably the best form of vehicle for me because it's incredibly efficient when tooling around town but still has the ability to pull small trailers when I need to.

My brother doesn't haul furniture, doesn't ever need to tow anything, and doesn't have a family. He has a cheap 2 door Toyota and a motorcycle. For him, those two vehicles represent a very cheap, very efficient, and fun way of getting around. It fits his situation specifically.

262,2023-03-20,"&gt;Falling Lithium Prices Are Making Electric Cars More ~~Affordable~~ Profitable for Car Companies Who Won't Pass The Savings To Consumers

Fixed that for you, NYT.

&gt;Instead, the drop in commodity prices has made it easier for carmakers to cut prices for electric vehicles. This month, Tesla lowered the prices of its two most expensive cars, the Model S sedan and Model X sport utility vehicle, by thousands of dollars.  
&gt;  
&gt;That followed cuts in January by Tesla to its more affordable Model 3 and Model Y, and by Ford Motor to its Mustang Mach-E. The average price of an electric vehicle in the United States fell by $1,000 in February compared with January, according to Kelley Blue Book.

Tesla decreasing their prices should not be considered as part of a larger trend because they kind of just do whatever the heck they want. And there needs to be more companies decreasing their prices beyond Ford and Chevrolet for it to even be a trend. The ID.4 only got a ""price decrease"" because the lower-end trims started going on sale, the Ioniq 5 and EV6 are still un-competitively overpriced, Rivian still has all of its orders at current prices to get through...

Anyone expecting the current automotive profit motive to go away any time soon despite decreasing raw materials costs is naive at best, IMO.",0

at the peak the price was about $100 per kg and its now down to $46

&gt; AC Level 1 Charging: A method that allows an EV/PHEV to be connected to the most common grounded electrical
&gt; receptacles (NEMA 5-15R and NEMA 5-20R). The vehicle shall be fitted with an on-board charger capable of
&gt; accepting energy from the existing single phase alternating current (AC) supply network. The maximum power
&gt; supplied for AC Level 1 charging shall conform to the values in Table 1.
&gt;
&gt; AC Level 2 Charging: A method that uses dedicated AC EV/PHEV supply equipment in either private or public
&gt; locations. The vehicle shall be fitted with an on-board charger capable of accepting energy from single phase
&gt; alternating current (AC) electric vehicle supply equipment. The maximum power supplied for AC Level 2
&gt; charging shall conform to the values in Table 1.

&gt; TABLE 1 - CHARGE METHOD ELECTRICAL RATINGS (NORTH AMERICA)
&gt;
&gt; AC Level 1
&gt;
&gt; 120 V AC, 1-phase 12 A continuous, 15 A circuit

And if I'm EA or CP, I'd be looking at apartment/condo complexes as prime targets to install lvl2/lvl3 chargers. But it's not there yet (or enough).

I have two EVs - one with \~250mi range (for adults) and another with \~60mi range (for teens). The 250mi EV charges at home in my garage with lvl2 and the 60mi EV charges in the garage using lvl1. It works out just fine. Overnight is plenty to recharge the 60mi EV via lvl1 and the 250mi EV via lvl2.

Saying that ""about 80% of \[charging\], according to the U.S. Department of Energy"" happens at home really is unfair because of course the vast majority of charging is being done at home. Where else is it going to be done? The public charging infrastructure is a joke, and charging for renters is almost non-existent.

Not wanting to bring up those very real, very valid, points in a discussion about EV charging is rather disingenuous.

The very article you're sharing states this very point:

&gt;Ultimately, I don‚Äôt think the biggest problem facing electric vehicle charging is the insufficient and unreliable public fast charging network... Instead, it‚Äôs the rarity of ‚Äúhome‚Äù charging in apartment and condominium buildings.

People need EV charging available at their apartment complex and condos.

It even goes on to talk about a very real problem that I face every day as a apartment dweller that relies on shared EV charging at home.

&gt;Every building would assuredly be different, but each would have to deal with the very real problem of what to do with fully charged cars squatting indefinitely at charger spaces.

The truth of the matter is that roughly only 60% of Americas (I focus on America because that article is) actually own a home. The rest living at the whim of condominium HOAs, and apartment complexes. The struggle for those 40% of Americas  is very real and worth bringing up in this discussion.

Personally, I can't go grocery shopping without a car; it's too far to walk, too dangerous to bike, and there's no transit option. Before moving to my current house, though, I lived in an apartment in a nearby town where I still needed to drive for a lot of things but the distances were shorter and I could walk to the grocery store; I racked up about half as many miles per year of driving then as I do now.

As with **the internet, the interstate system, and rural electrification**, it's choosing a government that actually works for people (instead of one wanting to be in power to skim money off the top for them and their friends) that makes the difference. Imagine an America without these three things. 

Just [90 years ago, only 10% of people in rural people had electricity at home or in the workplace](https://americanhistory.si.edu/blog/rural-electrification). By the end of the 1940s, approximately half of all farms had access to electricity. By 1953, rural Americans could access electricity as easily as urban dwellers could... 

In 1915, it took Erwin ""Cannonball"" Baker 271 hours and 15 minutes (11 days, 7 hours and 15 minutes) to drive his Stutz Bearcat race car from LA to New York in what's now called the Cannonball Run. The car was capable of going 80mph but his average speed was much lower because of the lack of an interstate highway system. In 1964 the 50 hour goal was bettered with a time of 48 hours and 9 minutes. In 1971 the record (on the now recognized official route from the Red Ball Garage in downtown Manhattan, NY to the Portofino Inn / Hotel in Redondo, California) [beat a day and a half with a time of 35 hours 54 minutes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannonball_Run_challenge) - thanks in part to faster cars, and partly because the trip was undertaken by teams of drivers working in shifts, but also because of the Interstate system allowing efficient movement of vehicles without winding local roads and the need to stop for crossing traffic and pedestrians... 

Robert Kahn and Vinton Cerf, creators of TCP/IP, [wrote this letter](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~fessler/misc/funny/gore,net.txt) acknowledging that ""there is no question in our minds that while serving as Senator, [Vice President Al] Gore's initiatives had a significant and beneficial effect on the still-evolving Internet. The fact of the matter is that Gore was talking about and promoting the Internet long before most people were listening... As far back as the 1970s Congressman Gore promoted the idea of high speed telecommunications as an engine for both economic growth and the improvement of our educational system. He was the first elected official to grasp the potential of computer communications to have a broader impact than just improving the conduct of science and scholarship"" and how he ""provided intellectual leadership by helping create the vision of the potential benefits of high speed computing and communication.  As an example, he sponsored hearings on how advanced technologies might be put to use in areas like coordinating the response of government agencies to natural disasters and other crises"". The two godfathers of the internet conclude: ""No one in public life has been more intellectually engaged in helping to create the climate for a thriving Internet than the Vice President.  Gore has been a clear champion of this effort, both in the councils of government and with the public at large.""

Ford and GM (and Stellantis) are based in and major employers in the state.  Meaning sales of vehicles developed and/or built in the state supports the local economy.  Not only does it help pay the employees in the state, it keeps most of the sales revenue in the state.

Are Michigan voters willing to give non-union Tesla a tax giveaway when they have almost no employment presence in the state, where they're largely based in Texas, California, Nevada, and China where most of the sales revenue would flow out of Michigan.  Not to mention that a large chunk of that revenue flows up to the executives and shareholders rather than the workers (per the claimed 'record' profit margins), thus facilitating a record transfer of wealth upwards from the customer base to wealthy people.

Seems like that would be a pretty silly idea.

People give unions (who demand a higher chunk of the sales revenue and strong worker protections, and give workers lobbying power in congress) a lot of crap... but well paid workers facilitate the flow of capital through the overall economy, rather than pushing it straight to the top.

Just look at what he's done at Twitter.  7500 employees in 2022 is now down to less than 2000.    He certainly makes extremely efficient companies, but does that really improve life for workers?

Hardly a surprise that a manufacturer that makes the most cars, whose cars are on the road longer than anyone elses, also have the most cars being traded for new ones.

Overwhelmingly EVs are currently in those aspirational tiers, even from manufacturers that are not traditionally aspirational brands.

**TLDR yes, you want it, but it makes them lose money, and you don't have a choice of another charger because there are so few, so you'll suck it up and deal**

Removing apps and adding direct credit card payments means the company providing the chargers doesn't make as much money.  

Without an app, they can't collect and sell your data to third parties.  Your data is valuable and the charging company wants to trade that value for cash for them.

Accepting credit cards at the charger means more expensive terminals that may have to accept chip reading cards.  Additionally accepting credit cards at terminals means higher compliance costs to comply with PCI regulations.

Also with an app and forcing the payment through the app it means they can make you buy chunks of charging which is good for the charging company for two reasons:

* they get interest free loans from the thousand or millions of unused balance on the accounts
* their credit card transaction fees are lower because they can make fewer authorizations and credit cards usually have a flat fee per transaction *and* a percentage of the transaction.  As an example, if there is a 25 cent flat fee and 3% on the whole transaction, if you're forced to buy charging at $20 a time and use it in $5 chunks, they only have  single flat fee.  If you use $5 at a time and are able to purchase $5 at a time, they charging company just lost 75 cents of pure profit from your $20 purchase.",15

An old EV battery pack is basically proven safe. But it's definitely possible that some issues also develop with time.

Having commercial vehicles compared to mostly private ev ones is def another weak point in this study. A much more in depth study would have to take into account hours running, age, maintenance, cause of the fire and so on.

I didn't say that they do? I said ""it could mean"".

I guess the comment was phrased confusingly. It seems EVs catch fire in Norway more often than in Sweden (could just be difference in how statistics is reported, or I may have overlooked something!). I was saying the data can be explained by two possible options:

\1. Older EVs, that is, EVs that have been on the road a few years and gotten wear and tear, catch fire more often. Norway have far more of those than Sweden. So to be concrete, maybe a 10 year old Nissan Leaf catches fire more than when that same Leaf model was brand new. I wrote that I don't think this is true. So I don't know why you'd think I was saying that's the case?

OR

\2.	Newer models, engineered with inherently safer battery packs, catch fire less often. So, maybe a 2011-model Leaf might catch fire more often than a 2022-model Leaf. Not because the 2011-model is worn down but because the battery pack design is bad. And that those new models will keep catching fire less often even when they get old.

You can though and I certainly will. It's not entirely their fault, but a huge company like Toyota leading Japan's vehicle electrification would have probably singlehandedly forced Japan to become energy independent and increase their electrical grid output.

>In the US maybe but Japan's energy grid can't survive mass ev adoption. The only thing they can do is hold on to ICE cars or go the nuclear option, literally. 

Very true but it's because complete failure in Japanese government policy. They've decided importing 80% of their oil and gas is better than energy independence. Not only is this insanely expensive for the government, but conflicts directly with any environmental goals. It would be cheaper if Japan would build more nuclear and renewables, and possibly make them energy independent. Which for a variety of reasons is kind of essential for a modern developed country. I think Japan is building more nuclear and investing in renewables but like all countries should have been done a decade or two ago. Japan's grid isn't ready for mass ev adoption, but slowly they can do it.

A dozen Teslas had come and gone in the meantime and I just watched the Rivian driver try and try and try to get the car charging.

3) and frankly I should lead with this:  the egmp cars don't charge fast at all on V3 superchargers (the ones which have been retrofitted with magic docks so far).  It has to do with voltage and max current mismatches.  So until more V4 superchargers start opening up in my area, I'm not going to feel like I'm missing out here.

In The Netherlands we barely hear about problems with the charging infrastructure and there being a lack. Partially being helped by having virtually every car (yeah the Leaf exists) on CCS-2. That also means all Tesla Superchargers have been open to all cars for well over a year now and Tesla users could have always used any public rapid charger.

13,2023-05-26,"Is this suggesting that Tesla will stop installations of their Magic docks, forcing OEMs to buy adapters for every vehicle they produce?  If so... then I was under the impression that an agreement between the current administration and Tesla had already been made.  Is Tesla going back on its word and won't be opening their network to other OEMs, unless the OEM signs an agreement with Tesla and installs their software/hardware in their cars?

Oof... what a can of worms this could open.

Ford didn't say they were doing away with the CCS plug on their cars, just that they'd be adding NACS plugs.  I'm guessing that means they'll be adding both for now. If they are getting rid of CCS plugs, then they'll still need CCS adapters, which... they'd buy from Tesla?  Their direct competitor?  Either way, they're doubling the number of connectors that need to be produced for each of their vehicles.

I wonder which solution is better for the environment.

* 18k magic docks to replace all of Tesla's charging plugs.
* Potentially millions of adapters.  

Hmmm....

Ford did say they'd be installing Tesla software on their vehicles.  As I've explained many times before, Tesla's stations are so simple because the billing software is installed in their cars, not on their chargers, allowing them to avoid adding complex billing hardware/software on their chargers requiring a constant internet connection.  Instead, the car is what tracks the transaction and submits the data to Tesla servers periodically, who's keeping the owners credit card information on record and submits the transaction.

It's also been a hypothesis of mine that this was one of the main reasons other OEMs would never agree to use Tesla's network; because they'd need to install Tesla made hardware and software in their cars, paying Tesla for the privilege of using Tesla chargers and also paying Tesla for electricity, all while potentially providing valuable customer data to Tesla.  It's one thing to support a third party network who has no skin in the automotive manufacturing game... it's another to support your direct competition.",0
13,2023-05-26,"Not universally true. I was at one in Denver where all the V3 superchargers put out 30kW at best. Google reviews showed it that way for months. There would have been no way to know the station was fucked without randomly pulling up Google reviews for the location.

I hope that at least in Ford making this move they believe in the reality of a collaborative governance. I think in my mind SAE would be more open but both late 00's early 10's Tesla and SAE were doing a lot of mutual ""not invented here"" which helped noone.",0

Next, you're conflating level 2 and level 3 stations. Focusing on level 3, Chargepoint does have a few hundred more DCFC stations than EA, but fewer chargers at each. That combines to mean they actually have less US DCFCs then EA, at around 2,000 stalls.

I still think the industry as a whole prefers CCS, and I doubt most of them really want to go to NACS. Ford seemed like at the top of my list in terms of companies I think would be most likely to move on NACS as Ford seems very agile and adaptive out of all the ‚Äúlegacy‚Äù automakers, but hell, even Ford had some reluctancy. I don‚Äôt think they want to hand over the charging standard their car uses to one of their main competitors, even if it is better for the consumer.

Sure, CCS1 is the worse standard, but any BEV that isn‚Äôt a Tesla or now Ford uses it, and that‚Äôs a *lot* of manufacturers, so now it‚Äôs a great divide. I just feel like it‚Äôll take a lot more to make NACS the standard most manufacturers use. So now we are back in a CCS vs CHAdeMO situation which we shouldn‚Äôt be *back in* so relatively far into the BEV transition.

I also worry about CCS cars on the road today and for the foreseeable future. Sure, Tesla has the Magic Dock, but now that they‚Äôve seen that they can make a manufacturer switch to their whole standard completely, will they just reduce the Magic Dock rollout significantly? So then CCS cars will not be able to charge as easily on the supercharger network than initially expected? And if Magic Dock is rolled out as planned (which I hope). Then what‚Äôs really the point of adding NACS on a CCS car if the V4 Super Charger has CCS, to charge at V3, with the cord that can barely reach any Ford as it is today?

If what Tesla wants to happen happens, are all CCS cars out now screwed unless they have an adaptor?

If you are paying less taxes due to retirement contributions, that means you are contributing to a pre-tax ""traditional"" retirement account. 

Therefor, you can increase your federal tax burden for the year by rolling over some or all of your retirement savings to a post-tax ""ROTH"" account. Any money you roll over will count as income for that tax year and you'll owe federal taxes on it just like normal income.

Even of Tesla has no intention to abuse their position, it's a valuable position to have. The mega-tech companies run their businesses in similar ways, with walled gardens within open standards. It has seen some abuse in the past, such as when Google shut off Play Store access to any OEM who sold non-Google android phones alongside Google Android phones. Similar situation in that while technically players like Samsung could sell Android phones without Google Maps and Gmail, it's not actually an option.

That's why I'd be wary. This is out of the tech overlord playbook. When real competitors come along (say there's new patent protected solid state battery tech) they may not negotiate in good faith, and at that point innovation is stifled by the gatekeeper. In some sense it makes me sad to see this business practice thrive for so long, but that's what happens when competition regulation is a century out of date.

CCS1, CCS2 (the connectors) both use CCS (the protocol).  So does NACS, in addition to the propriety Tesla signaling.  Switching to CCS2 would have been a step backward, not forward.

If every non-Tesla BEV ends up on the same standard, that means every L3 charger needs to be able to compete with Superchargers.

The charging companies will be aware of this and will work harder to have uptime and competency to compete. Before, people would choose a Tesla specifically to get on a better charging network, which was in turn shifting more and more people to Tesla's charging network.

Tesla has done a great job sizing their sites appropriately for demand, locating them appropriately so that there are fewer dead zones, choosing locations with easy access to restaurants, maintaining chargers so that they‚Äôre almost always working, and making the user experience second to none (you just plug in and charging starts in about 5 seconds instead of the slow and inconsistent experience initiating CCS1 charging).

1. Reliability of CCS chargers and fast chargers- companies in the US focus largely on expansion and much less on maintenance.

Going on a road trip and pulling up to a fast charger when there are only 4 stalls and 2 of them are broken is a big problem. 

2. NACS is an app free experience. All you need to do is link your card to your account (which is already linked to your car) so when you pull up to the charger, all you have to do plug in and charging starts. Since charging already takes much longer than gassing, every second counts. Making it a seamless experience really helps.

You know.. in case anyone doesn't know basic math, it's best to spend a few minutes on a call to explain how simple arithmetic works.

Meanwhile, the same cost savings they're talking about can be applied to all competitors given they all use the same materials, and thus what it could end up doing is simply leading to competition forcing sales prices down, with that same $1 billion in savings lost by reducing revenue by $1 billion.

Sales pull forward into 2023 will likely reduce demand in early 2024, requiring further price cuts.  Model Y inventory is building in the US, so expect those prices to come down further.  Interest rates could be higher for longer than expected, credit card debt is expanding, car defaults are increasing, so expect further price reductions in the US.

The Chinese economy is suffering so expect price cuts.

Tesla did raise wages in the US, so expect additional costs there... but they did cut stock option rewards to their employees... even though they claimed it was what set Tesla employees apart from union employees... so now Musk no longer has that to hold over the heads of their employees to keep them from unionizing.",-15

Tesla is Elon, and Elon is Tesla. As a Tesla owner, that fact makes me seriously regret the decision I made years ago to buy my car.

I personally owned a 2019 Model 3 for 4.5 years and had negative experiences with a few of the OTA updates, such as the first V11 rollout that buried heated seat and defroster controls behind a separate menu layer. Or the numerous relocations of the Homelink controls which wouldn't even appear when needed at least 1/4 of the time, forcing me to dive into settings to find the backup control. It also took far too long for very basic flaws to be addressed - we couldn't manually control the wiper speed from the steering wheel until 2023, yet the software team had time to roll out all kinds of useless gimmicks like games and light shows. Oh yeah, the LTE modem would constantly take 5+ minutes to reconnect after driving out of my underground condo garage, crippling the nav system and making the voice commands unusable in the meantime...¬†


Elon himself doesn't help when he defends asinine decisions like the climate controls in the initial V11 update with tweets like ""all input is error"". And he doesn't even have the balls to publicly admit it after user backlash eventually forces them to patch things back (took about 3 months for V11 to finally restore the quick toggles. Also remember the flip flop on the yoke?).¬†

I'll add ‚Äî¬†Tesla's particular case with the CT is likely a non-issue. A lot of people just expect that a crash automatically means a deployment, but it's not that simple.

Having an F-150 Lightning, I can say I like having a lot of the ‚Äúluxuries‚Äù that my Tesla lacks. Cross traffic alerts, an actual instrument cluster in front of me, hands free driving without needing to constantly nudge the steering wheel: that stuff makes a difference.

Despite all the negative comments I found online (the Model 3's first year was 2017 but, really, the first available vehicles came out in 2018... or so I'm told!) I found most reviews were *extremely* positive regarding the car but I wanted to wait until they ironed out the major ""glitches"" before taking the plunge.

My Model 3, frankly, was a revelation.  I've ""only"" been driving since 1981 or thereabouts and in the years since have experienced a whole host of cars, good, bad, mediocre, and *terrible*.  The Model 3, to my mind, was like moving from a flip phone to an iPhone.

In time the Model Y came out and, again, I waited a year or so to get it... for my wife.  She was extremely skeptical and insisted her Toyota Highlander was just fine.  It didn't take very long before she admitted to me the MY was also leagues ahead of what she was used to.

So this past weekend, and with the overstock in Tesla vehicles, I noticed there were plenty of sales.  I decided to give it a look see and was especially interested in whether I could transfer my FSD to any new vehicle I should buy.

...welp...

Not only was that an option, but with a trade in value offered of just north of $20K for my 2019 Model 3 and a $7500 tax credit applied in the sale, I walked away with a brand new Model Y for $19.8K...!!!!!!!

Yeah, I'll take that deal any day of the week.

And while I don't feel I'm married to Tesla (and I've come to be really turned off by Musk), the car itself is damn good and I have no issues with it.  I hope other competitors step up to the plate and make even better EVs, but for now, I'm good with my new MY.",82

Maybe I'd reconsider if they walk back the stalks, but it would take a lot for my next car to be a Tesla. The lack of radar is also a problem.

Over this past weekend and because there is an overstock of Tesla cars, I traded in my 2019 Model 3 for a brand new Model Y.  Between the trade in value for my Model 3, porting the Full Self-Driving over to the Model Y, and a $7500 tax credit, I walked away with the Model Y for only $19.8K.

1. When I bought my Tesla there was no real competition that meets my needs and wants (crossover-ish size, 250 mile range, adequate charging network) .  Now there are multiple options that meet my needs.  
2. The things I like about my Tesla almost exclusively relate to it being an EV.  I like that I can refuel at home for cheap.  I like that it has peppy acceleration.  I like that I don't have to get oil changes and do other fluid maintenance.  Aside from the app, there is nothing that I really like about my car that is exclusive to Tesla.  
3. There are quite a few things I don't like about my car.  I hate the lack of physical buttons.  I hate how poorly the TACC/AP system works.  I hate the shitty material quality.  I hate all of the rattling noises that are ""in spec"".  I hate that twice a year my car smells like a locker room and requires me to cram myself in the passenger foot space to change and clean filters because of a dumb design flaw.

I‚Äôve been impressed with the Ioniq models, moreso the Ioniq 5 versus the Ioniq 6.  I thought the Polestar was kinda disappointing to be honest‚Ä¶ rather a bland vehicle overall.  Not horrible, mind you, but rather so-so IMHO.  I thought the Mach E was good but it really felt like Ford was trying to emulate the Model Y.  Also, the rear seat space was less than the Model Y.  Otherwise, though, I liked it!  We were driven in the Rivian pickup (they didn‚Äôt have the SUV model either year) and it was fine but truthfully I‚Äôm not into pickup trucks.  I am very intrigued by their upcoming ‚Äúsmaller‚Äù SUVs, though.

There was a Lucid to see but not drive (nice, but I really can‚Äôt say how it feels driving it) as well as a Hummer but, again, see but not drive so I could get no impression on it.

The first year I was there they had a Cadillac Lyriq and, the test driver told me, it was one of only two prototypes on the street *that year*.  I thought it was fine but it didn‚Äôt totally wow me.  The VW ID.4 was pretty nice as well but didn‚Äôt have the pickup some of the other cars had.  Not a bad vehicle, though!

So, to make a long story short (too late, I know), I‚Äôve been very interested in trying out ALL EVs out there.  I‚Äôm very much a convert to EVs and am pretty sure I will never again get myself an ICE vehicle.  I‚Äôll keep going to the car shows and checking out the various vehicles for sure and, again, my hope is that soon enough I‚Äôll be more comfortable going for other EVs than a Tesla.

8,2024-04-10,"Ok so first up: I've literally only had my new Model Y for like 2 days and haven't really explored all the major differences between it and my Model 3 and so far haven't even used the FSD at all.

When I have used the FSD, it was for long distance trips and while I was on the highway.  I live in Florida and most of the roads are long and straight and the FSD always seemed to work pretty well for that but I will admit up front I HAVE NOT experienced much in terms of winding roads or hills (Florida is pretty flat land!).

The second thing I would note and its something that is at times exciting about Tesla but also annoying: Those dudes sure like to jump whole heartedly into ""new"" things and often it seems like caution would have worked better.

For example, when I first bought my 2019 Model 3, the automatic windshield wipers weren't all that great.  However, with each new upgrade I found they worked better and better to the point where they really seemed effective... until there came a new update a few months back and suddenly they were total crap...!  Now, there have been a few updates since then and they are now working far better than they were before but, again, another example where caution might have worked better than simply jumping into whatever new software update they forced on people.

I've also found that the FSD has improved over time as well but, and I'm being dead honest here, we're still far from a ""true"" FSD system.  When I bought my Model 3, the FSD price I believe was around 6-8 thousand and now its around 12K and... I dunno if I would invest in it again if I had the chance.  It's good but its still got issues.  However, porting the FSD to my new car free was an absolute no-brainer and I will, perhaps this coming weekend, test it out some more and see how it feels.

Either way, though, my enjoyment of my Tesla vehicle is not totally decided by the FSD.  I like how it drives in general, love the navigator system, and love the fact that I can charge at home.  I love the ""quiet"" drive and not having to hear a motor (I'm old enough to have enjoyed the roar of the older V8s but, let's face it, nowadays most engine noises you hear are annoying).  I enjoy not having to go to gas stations and I really enjoy the Supercharger systems allowing me to travel all over the place.

Ultimately, one will either come away happy with a Tesla or will not.  I really like the car even as I'm willing to admit not everything Musk promised has come to be.  It is still, IMHO, an excellent vehicle and I would gladly buy it again... especially with the deal I found!",0

That last bit is painfully important because I recently got my car back from an out of state collision center. It took 5 months to get all the parts needed for the full repairs and the total wasn't fully covered by the at-fault driver's insurance (fuck State Farm).

I needed an EV that wasn‚Äôt going to inconvenience my family too much on road trips, and the Tesla network plus being able to charge my Tesla from 10-80% in 26 minutes or 10-60% in 15 minutes is great. Ford getting access to Superchargers fixed the network concern, and Ford also just announced the new Mach-e will have improved charging speed, but they only improved the 10-80% time to 36 minutes, which still isn‚Äôt quite enough for my liking.

16,2024-04-11,"Tesla sales were up 35% in 2023, and Musk was an idiot that entire year.

There's a few reasons that can't keep growing that much:

* Competition is improving
* Federal tax rebates no longer qualify for the Model 3, which makes up like 35% of Tesla's sales
* Federal interest rates were higher in Q1 of this year than Q1 last year
* Many parts of the US are not transitioning quickly to EVs, which limits the growth potential.
* Used market for EVs was flooded with EVs, especially Teslas, which will hurt sales of their new cars directly as people choose cheaper options. It also makes it more difficult for people with used Teslas to sell theirs at the prices they were expecting, so there are fewer people upgrading to newer ones.

Elon isn't helping sales, but I think that was true a year ago so it doesn't explain why just this quarter sales weren't higher than a year ago.",-16

14,2024-04-11,">But the one-size-fits-all 'all user input is error' mindset says they're not going to do that, in fact they're going to do just the opposite.

Not just that, but a ""one size fits all"" model lineup is also going to lose them market share. Even if they keep it to the ""main four"" plus the Cybertruck, they really could use more factory personalizations and trim options.

Like Toyota has the RAV4 Adventure, Ford has the Explorer Timberline... Yet Tesla doesn't offer any appearance or capability packages for the Model Y, as an example. And the vast majority of car buyers aren't going to want to go aftermarket beyond a set of WeatherTech floor mats.

Heck, even some more interesting factory paint colors would make Tesla's lineup more appealing. But I guess it requires several years of development and hype for Tesla to come out with a red color that looks 90 percent like the red color they already had.",-14

61,2024-04-21,"I'm one of these people, and the answer is I won't know until I see the direction the company goes in. 

Note that I am not a culture warrior about this stuff (and I don't think many Tesla boycotters truly are, even if that is what the internet dialogue suggests). Instead, I look at Elon's ranting about everything in this social philosophy space, combined with his statements of pure impossibility (10 microns) about Tesla, and I simply don't accept anything he says as being anywhere close to reality. So when Tesla lets him run his mouth on behalf of the company, I'm stuck on the notion that Musk controls everything - and I'm not going to buy a vehicle that this guy puppetmasters into existence. 

I'm one of the few people who loves the Cybertruck on paper. I think it looks cool, I think the specs are in line with what I need/want in a truck, and I think the prices will eventually drop to the point where they make sense. I'd even go so far as to say that odd panel gaps are quirky and give a vehicle a slapped-together character reminiscent of Halo Warthogs or Borderlands Runners or Mad Max machines (and I'm ALL about that kind of shit). But because of Musk I've assumed for years now that the Cybertruck was going to have much bigger issues than panel gaps, and surprise surprise - that's where we're at. 

When Elon Musk says Teslas are great, I don't trust him. When Tesla owners tell me their Teslas are great, I can't trust that Elon still makes them that way. If any other auto company CEO pushed out a Pinto, they'd be shown the door. Musk has too much power at Tesla, so he's a liability as long as he is there.",-61

For me, Elon leaving the company would be necessary but not sufficient to reconsider owning a Tesla. The company would need to also reverse course on some of his worst decisions:

- Never use the phrase ""Full Self Driving"" in product marketing again (it's a lie and always has been).
- Give us turn signal and wiper stalks. These things are de facto standards for a reason.
- Steering wheels should be wheel-shaped.
- Put actual mechanical door handles on the cars so that people can escape more easily in an emergency. Full door frames too so the window doesn't need to roll partway down.
- Bring back radar; magic AI pixie dust is never going to fix hardware shortcomings.
- Cancel the Cybertruck (I'm sure that will happen sooner or later anyway since I can't imagine it will ever be profitable).
- Make a car with a hatchback. A real one, not the silly hybrid trunk thing on the Model Y.
- Rename all the models. ""S3XY"" is cringe. While you're at it, how about printing the model name on the back of each car (like everyone else does) so that laypeople can tell them apart.

Worth noting that the reason for the fastback design of the hatchbacks that Tesla has designed to date - the Model S, the Model X, the Model Y, and the next-gen Roadster (designed, not released) - is aerodynamics. So, a squareback hatchback/wagon would likely have worse aero and therefore worse range.

I doubt they'll do the full window frames or cancel the Cybertruck (if it gets to the point where it doesn't lose money per-unit, it's worth continuing it because the engineering expense has already been spent), although a lot of the German cars with frameless windows use microswitches in the mechanical door handles to drop the window quickly before the latch is disengaged.

Meaning more users to your SC charging network, then you are going to end the charging business by layoff the entire SC team.

And reducing/eliminating future SC buildouts in order to cut costs. 

Once all the other brands have access to the supercharger, using said superchargers will become a nightmare!! 
SC are already filled to capacity in the morning and evening in my area.

Such a moronic way to hurt the brand. Just when you thought you had a very good opportunity for generating a really good income stream for the company.


And would seemingly seem like Tesla is going full on on FSD. Except, FSD kinda really sucks.

Under the hood, it's just god-awful everything. A Frankenstein of firmware from different manufacturers and different teams that don't talk to each other properly, and aren't consistent across cars even within the same trim and model year. Plug an OBDII scanner into one of their ID series EVs and you'll get dozens of errors it's hiding from the driver. The techs don't even bother clearing them, as it's just normal for almost every module in the car to be reporting intermittent errors almost all of the time for the life of the vehicle. 

Modules of the car don't communicate with each other properly, they often brick themselves during firmware updates, the cars had to be hooked up to 12V battery tenders for 8+ hours to do the first round of firmware updates at dealers to get up to a baseline where they can accept OTA updates without bricking themselves in driveways/garages. We're like 6+ months into that first OTA update and it still hasn't reached all eligible vehicles in North America. They have to roll it out so slowly because they know a portion of the cars on the road will be bricked by the update and they don't want to overwhelm dealer service centers, which can only manage manually updating one or two cars per bay per day.

Even the 2024s on infotainment software 4.0 have the same core issues as the original ID.x's on 2.1: one morning your headlights will fail their startup self-check for no reason, another afternoon the coolant pump will think something's wrong, and all screens might go black and reboot themselves mid-drive at any time. Even when everything seems fine, a cold boot of the infotainment software can take up to a full minute -- you can be out your garage, down the driveway, down a street or two, exiting your neighborhood before it's gotten far enough to start looking for your phone to launch Android Auto or Apple CarPlay.

69,2024-05-09,"This isn't exactly new information. The former President has made his policy goals quite clear.

Highlights:

>Trump‚Äôs response stunned several of the executives in the room overlooking the ocean: You all are wealthy enough, he said, that you should raise $1 billion to return me to the White House. At the dinner, he vowed to immediately reverse dozens of¬†President Biden‚Äôs environmental rules and policies and stop new ones from being enacted, according to people with knowledge of the meeting, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe a private conversation.

>Giving $1 billion would be a ‚Äúdeal,‚Äù Trump said, because of the taxation and regulation they would avoid thanks to him, according to the people.

>Trump‚Äôs remarkably blunt and transactional pitch reveals how¬†the former president is targeting¬†the oil industry to finance his reelection bid. At the same time, he has turned to the industry¬†to help shape his environmental agenda for a second term, including the rollbacks of some of Biden‚Äôs signature achievements on clean energy and electric vehicles.

\[...\]

>Despite the oil industry‚Äôs complaints about Biden‚Äôs policies, the United States is now producing more oil than any country ever has, pumping nearly 13 million barrels per day on average last year. ExxonMobil and Chevron, the largest U.S. energy companies, reported their biggest annual profits in a decade last year.

>Yet oil giants will see an even greater windfall ‚Äî helped by new offshore drilling, speedier permits and other relaxed regulations ‚Äî in a second Trump administration, the former president told the executives over the dinner of chopped steak at Mar-a-Lago.

>Trump vowed at the dinner to immediately end the Biden administration‚Äôs freeze on permits for new liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports ‚Äî a top priority for the executives, according to three people present. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll get it on the first day,‚Äù Trump said, according to the recollection of an attendee.

\[...\]

>At the dinner, Trump also promised that he would scrap Biden‚Äôs ‚Äúmandate‚Äù on electric vehicles ‚Äî mischaracterizing ambitious rules that the Environmental Protection Agency recently finalized, according to people who attended. The rules require automakers to reduce emissions from car tailpipes, but they don‚Äôt mandate a particular technology such as EVs. Trump called them ‚Äúridiculous‚Äù in the meeting with donors.

>The fossil fuel industry has aggressively lobbied against the EPA‚Äôs tailpipe rules, which could eat into demand for its petroleum products. The American Fuel & Petrochemical Manufacturers, an industry trade group, has launched a seven-figure campaign against what it calls a de facto ‚Äúgas car ban.‚Äù The campaign includes ads in battleground states warning that the rule will restrict consumer choice.

\[...\]

>Although the repeal of the EPA rule would benefit the fossil fuel industry, it would probably anger the auto industry, which has invested billions of dollars in the transition away from gasoline-powered cars. Many automakers are under increasing pressure to sell more EVs in Europe, which has tightened its own tailpipe emissions rules, and they are eager to avoid a patchwork of regulations around the globe.

>‚ÄúAutomakers need some degree of regulatory certainty from government,‚Äù said John Bozzella, president and CEO of the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, which represents Ford, General Motors, Stellantis, Toyota and other car companies.

>‚ÄúWhat has emerged instead is a wholesale repeal‚Ä¶ and then reinstatement‚Ä¶ and then repeal again of regulations every four or eight years,‚Äù Bozzella said in an email.",0

4. Energy independence.  Constant bitching about energy and oil and how we have to work with the Middle East for oil.  How global politics can effect gas/oil prices.  Guess what?  Energy in the US is created in the US.

5. Energy independence to the extreme:  Solar. You can't make your own gasoline at home but you sure as shit can put up a solar array and start producing power at home.  Solar in the US is unnecessarily bureaucratic and complicated by comparison to most parts of the world.  In places like Australia who have very high cost of living, they still have MUCH cheaper solar because they don't make it some insane process.  It's fucking mounting panels on a roof and connecting a few electrical devices.  It's pretty damn simple.

Republicans against EVs are either ignorant, stupid, or insanely biased (make money from fossil fuels).  I'm not saying they have to love EVs but being against them definitely falls into one of those three categories.",-44

It had a few hiccups, but it was a LOT better than I thought it would be. The few times I had to intervene were mostly because I wasn't comfortable with the situation. For example, I didn't like that it didn't seem to pay attention to semi's blind spots, and would just cruise right beside them. My longest trips was 140 miles on a not-so-busy highway and it was nearly perfect. I didn't intervene one time.

For the amount of miles my wife drives, $99 is too much for me. However, if I was going on a long road trip and planned on using a lot in a month, I would pay $99. I think for our amount of usage, $30 would be about right.

  
Everyone I know that tried it a lot, was really impressed. There were a few things that people complained about like accelerating fast at lights, which is more of a preference thing, which I actually enjoyed.

It made me hate AutoPilot even more. There is zero reason that I shouldn't be able to switch lanes without interrupting the cruise control. My Kia does lane centering, just like the Tesla, but when I turn on the signal it allows me to switch lanes without deactivating anything.",47

PHEVs should be encouraged by this regulation, not discouraged ‚Äì they are an extremely efficient use of limited and expensive minerals, provide significant GHG reduction benefits, are more affordable than similar BEVs, and require less reliance on charging infrastructure.*

Toyota says the previous proposed EPA methodology ‚Äî sourced primarily from European studies  ‚Äî doesn't fairly represent PHEV utility factor (the expected rate at which owners will charge their vehicles) in the US, and suggests the EPA should use the SAE method instead. This is true, and has been discussed at length in this subreddit ‚Äî European studies typically examine (and often acknowledge the limitations of) markets where commercial fleets have *disincentives* to maximize the utility factors of their PHEVs.

InfluenceMap assesses this as *negative action*, because it's Toyota disagreeing with the EPA and advocating for a more lenient assessment of a *particular* powertrain configuration ‚Äî¬†but InfluenceMap *does not assess* whether the claim is justified, or could lead to better carbon emissions outcomes. They just... stop there. Anything other than wholesale support of the 'status quo' GHG emissions path is deemed negative, and the scores are arbitrary. If an OEM continues to press the issue, InfluenceMap [keeps accruing negative](https://lobbymap.org/score/Toyota-Motor-Q11-D4) points for that OEM. No nuance, no discussion, no anything. In essence, engagement and negotiation is deemed bad, whether the end result is positive in the real-world or not. 

It's a particularly perverse way of assessing progress, and InfluenceMap should not be taken seriously. 

TLDR: InfluenceMap is not reliable. This report is bunk.",-23

Plenty of CEOs have yielded 1300% returns over 6 year periods.  To my knowledge, none have been granted 1) compensation equivalent to 25% of the company; 2) compensation equivalent to $55 billion,

This is a failure of the Tesla board to not properly negotiate the terms of the compensation package.  In exchange for this lack of negotiation, the board received compensation of $25M per board member per year for years.  The average compensation for a Fortune 500 board member is $500,000.  Until two recent rulings in Delaware court, Musk and the Boards comp weren‚Äôt subject to shareholder vote.  Now they are.  

Musk has made public statements that he is spending less than 25% of his time on Tesla and the company is going to hell.  The cyber truck is a disaster, growth is dropping, quality is down, customer service is shit, and no one is at the wheel.

When I converted to electric (got a moped too), I found it very, very difficult to ride around and not kill pedestrians.  It required a much, much higher sense of alertness and awareness of the street life.  

When I started riding my electric motorbike class instead of the elecrric moped, I was grateful for having had this prior experience at lower speeds and power ratings, because it was an order of magnitude more dangerous.

The whole labeling of electric as ‚Äúgay‚Äù or ‚Äúweak‚Äù or whatever is just bullshit machismo that I don‚Äôt contend with.  

Because, you have to be far tougher and more alert and competent when riding electric in the cities. The torque envelope is far more aggressive, the danger circumstances are broader - but in the other hand, regen braking is awesome, and you can use it to your advantage too.  

Electric motorbikes have a far greater potential to kill and require a lot more rider responsibility, imho - at least in cities where pedestrians have been conditioned that if the street is silent, it‚Äôs okay to just walk without looking.

My 2020 palisade was in a hit and run by a stolen car, it was my rear right quarter panel and rear bumper and tail light. No suspension damage, nothing internal, just the 3 body panels (the passenger side rear quarter panel is split in two)  and the light. Total cost before insurance - $28k. Took the shop 33 days, they installed the wrong tail light, it took them a week to get the correct one, and they never actually got the parking sensors connected after 4 more visits.

Tesla's biggest net profit loss was in q2 2018, famously dubbed development hell by Musk, where they had a net loss of 718 million. This was in a quarter where they had 4 billion in revenue. 

Contrast that with Rivian, they've been averaging a quarterly net loss of around 1.5 \*billion\* since they started manufacturing their truck in q3 2021. Their biggest quarterly net loss was almost 2.5 billion i q4 2021, where they made a measly 54 million in revenue. In their highest ever quarter back i q3 2023, they had revenue of 1.34 billion. In that quarter they had a net loss of 1.37 billion

There may be no mandate, strictly speaking, however we do have the ever slow creep of mandates to reduce emissions, which will eventually lead to an effective EV mandate.

On a semi-related note, I can understand being skeptical about these mandates.

One thing to come out of these mandates is the push by traditional OEMs to add ever increasing numbers of gears to the transmission. A 10 speed gear box has far more moving parts than a 5 speed, which causes an increased occurrence of transmission failures, and thus these modern cars are often thrown in the junkyard a lot sooner than older cars, which creates an increased demand on manufacturing, thus negating some of the reason emissions standards even exist in the first place.

See high speed footage at about 4:30:  
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=SYLAi4jwXcs

That would cut off most of your finger tip, though he is feeding the hot dog through much more quickly than you would actually do when cutting wood.

See at 6:45 for a lower feed speed example. That's a nick that is going to hurt and bleed a lot, but your finger will easily heal.

The entire detection mechanism for the SawStop *basically requires you to get your finger cut in order to trigger the mechanism*. It is triggering because your finger touched a saw blade tip that is rotating at ~3500 rpm. In 5 milliseconds, you're looking at about 1/3 blade rotation, which is about 8-15 teeth, depending on the blade. Part of that time is spent retracting down into the table, but your finger is likely to come into contact with several teeth in that time. You will absolutely be cut by that.",0

The SawStop inventor did go through a bunch of hotdogs before using his finger, but he did use his finger.

According to Wikipedia: 

>After numerous tests using a hot dog as a finger-analog, in spring 2000, Gass conducted the first test with a real human finger: he applied Novocain to his left ring finger, and after two false starts, he placed his finger into the teeth of a whirring saw blade.

SUVs and Crossovers: $47,061 on average, ranging from $30,353 for subcompacts to $74,502 for full-size

When every Joe in the country wants to be rich on EV-chargers instantly. I remember just over a year ago, here in Sweden, every Joe invested in a private Charging company. Every charger on every corner - had its own infrastructure.

1) You have the exotic miniature slow chargers on every corner, you see it, you have no clue how to use it because there's no sign with instructions and just a QR code that forces you to install ""Unknown-Joe-Company"" here, and...

2) Unknown Joe thinks he's brilliant and has his own Joe-App that after installation wants all your credit info. So after standing there for 30-40 minutes after finally getting approved to use the dinky Slow-charger miniature stick, wants you to ""bring-your-own-cable"" and...

3) Asks for you to have a subscription where you pay a Monthly fee, which makes it super expensive to use the dinky random Joe company charging stick, and ofc. there's only that location which you will use only 2 times a year.

4) Then there's the super-chargers. OFC. they are out of function, so the only working one has all of their slots filled up with Teslas, when there's a special Tesla charge park nearby, which require you to become a member of that too.

5) Then you have the chargers that have switched company agreements, so the one RFID tag  you had that claims they're in kahootz with all of the countrys chargers, doesn't work anymore - and you call customer service, which ofc. asks you via-robot-services to find and locate the charger station number, which is ofc. well hidden, and there's 100 different serial numbers.

6) Then you have the stations that needs a reset - you stand there for 30-60 minutes just to reach customer service, and you're now their on-site-remote-service-tech and are being told by a scripted external partner to do what you already did for 30 minutes so they can rule out those basic user-errors, and as a reward you'll be fined with the maximum charging price if they manage to reset the station, as a reward for being their on-site tech.

7) Then you have the vandalized stations no one uses or bothers to service, because let's face it, most people don't want to stand there in pouring rain for 60 minutes to fight charging customer services.

8) Then you have the company that finally accepts your RFID tag, but they charge more than gasoline for the power, and to top it of they decide to pull 50-100$ from your bank account in order to finally adjust the price.

9) Ofc. they don't talk to the other charging stations, so you get an additional fee of 50-100$ on the next station as well.

10) Yeah I'm gonna stop here, but there's 100's of examples. It's a bit better now, and the law is going to require ALL charging stations to accept credit cards soon, so sweet revenge greedy Joes hoping to become millionaires on overpriced slow-charging sticks in the ground.",68

While data collection may be one reason, a big reason is reducing cost.  If you charge a card each time you pay auth and other fees on top of the % that is paid to the card network and payment services provider.  Most of these apps use a sort of wallet model where they charge your card, say, $20, and if you use $10 you carry a balance.  This reduces the total number of charges, saving some money at scale.  It also allows for non-card payment methods (like PayPal), again, to reduce cost.

> Over the course of the last year or so, sales of battery electric vehicles, while continuing to grow, have posted lower year-over-year percentage growth rates than they had in previous years.

Let's make a fake data set that illustrates what they're saying:

Year 1: 1 million EVs sold  
Year 2: 2 million EVs sold  
Year 3: 3 million EVs sold

Year 1 to Year 2 saw a massive 100% increase in sales. But Year 2 to Year 3 is only seeing a 50% increase in sales.

So someone might say that suddenly because the growth rate is down from 100% to 50%, the rate of sales is slowing down.

That's not a slump, even if suddenly the growth rate in sales is down from 100% to 50%. In fact, that represents an increase of sold EVs.

It's like someone would say that, when accellerating from 0 to 100 kph, the car ""slows down"" after 30 kph because it's not accellerating as fast any more. Which is nonsense.

12,2024-09-12,"This doesn't make any sense.

Let's say you run down the battery to 20% before recharging. Starting from 100% across five days that's (100-20)/5=16% per day. Starting from 80% instead would give you (80-20)/16=3.75 days. Or more likely 4 days in practice since you'd go a little further down to 16%.

You can also think about it as ""I use about 16% per day. That's a tad less than the difference between 100% and 80%. So 80% will give my about a day less range"".

If you fully discharge the battery it just gets more clear cut. Using 100% over 5 days means 20% per day. If you start at 80%, it means you'll have 4 full days of use.",0

12,2024-09-12,"The reason for these two seemingly contradictory recommendations is different.

I'm not sure what type of battery you have in your car, ""MG"" doesn't really narrow it down for me. But I'm going to assume it's LFP.

The reason you want to charge an LFP battery up to 100% periodically is because it's required for the BMC to be able to properly determine the SoC of your battery.

On an NMC battery, you can make a fairly accurate determination of the SoC by just looking at the voltage, so this periodic charging to 100% is not needed for the same reason.

On LFP isn't not that simple, because the battery stays at the same voltage for a big part of the SoC curve, so the only way it can determine the SoC is to measure how much energy goes in to the battery vs how much goes out and keep a tally. Over time, that'll get less and less accurate, and a charge to 100% is needed to reset the counters and make them accurate again.

The reason you don't want to leave your car sitting above 80%, especially when it's hot, is the concern for battery degradation that can occur more rapidly in these cases.

The optimal thing you can do in your case is to try to time charging 100% only before you know you're going to be using the car soon, and preferably using at least 20% of your battery on that trip, because that'll satisfy both recommendations as well as possible. And only charging to 100% once a week, or when you know you're going to need it.

Basically you can boil this down to these three recommendations, in order of priority.

- Try to minimize the period of time your car stays at 100%, i.e. don't charge to 100% daily unless you need it.

- Do not charge to 100% if you plan on leaving your car unused for a while. Ideally, keep it closer to 50% SoC, since that'll be fine regardless of temperature.

- Charge to 100% once a week to maintain the optimal functioning of the SoC measurement. 

That said, if we go in the spirit of the OP here, the point of a car is for it to be used. You should ignore any of these recommendations above if they get in the way of how you intend to use your car. If you need the range, absolutely charge to 100% when you need to. That's what the battery's for.

You shouldn't bend over backwards to try to follow this kind of charging regime, but try to find a way to get as close to it as possible without inconveniencing yourself.

There are plenty of stories out there with batteries with high mileages that have survived just fine despite suboptimal management. And nobody really knows how batteries manufactured today will hold up in the long run, and how important these practices are.",0
11,2024-09-12,"I keep my vehicles for a long time.  My current truck that will be replaced by a Rivian is 18 years old.  Is that long enough for you?  I like to live my life in a not-in-constant-debt kind of way which is why my beach house is one year from being paid off before I reach 55.  I intend to keep our Tesla and the Rivian for a similar amount of time that we've kept other cars.  Glad you have a lifestyle you believe others should be beholden to, but I'm not part of that.  Keeping battery SOC within certain parameters is not hard nor stressful to me since I've done almost all my own car repairs for nearly 35 years.  I get your point, OP, but keeping vehicles up has worked for me quite well.",0
11,2024-09-12,"But at the same time, there is a balance point. I only charge to 80% normally, except once a month, or if I know I am leaving on a longer trip and need the range, because it is easy to do, and doesn‚Äôt affect my day to day. In some of these other threads people are recommending keeping it at 65% , and not above 80% for more than a few hours, or never. And unless the prevailing theories have changed, the difference between my behavior that doesn‚Äôt affect my usage of the car, and these other recommendations that would drastically affect my usage is 1-2% battery health over several years. It is simply not worth stressing that much over 1-2% to me. I‚Äôm not going to keep the car forever, but I‚Äôm also not going to destroy the battery when not doing so costs me nothing, and keeps the car from being worth even less when I trade it in.",0

Another example of this is on Interstate 10 between Palm Springs/Indio and Phoenix. There's a smattering of chargers in random towns, but Quartzsite, AZ is the midway point. 

In Quartzsite, there is an EA station with 4 stalls, a Rivian-only station with 6 stalls, and two Supercharger stations with a combined 120 stalls.

The post you're responding to is responding to the claim that the ""facelifted model 3"" is a downgrade.  The truth is that:  
  
* The new Model 3 is not just a facelift, and contains substantial upgrades  
  
* Aside from removing the turn signal and shift stalks, the Highland 3 is generally considered improved in every way.  Ride comfort, ventilated seats, efficiency, adaptative suspension (on P models), and general fit and finish have all been improved  
  
Your criticism of Tesla is somewhat true, but also largely irrelevant for a brand that is mostly selling commodity vehicles (3 and Y). 
 Much of what you said about overall design philosophy could be applied to Audi models as well.  An average person wouldn't be able to tell an A4 and an A6 apart.  Or maybe even a Q7 and Q8.  
  
There is no doubt that Tesla has been riding on its success, and the S and the X are definitely getting dated.  But the Y started out as a model year 2020 vehicle, and many manufacturers are still running on model year 2019 vehicles (e.g. RAV4), so it's not unheard of to keep vehicles longer than 5-6 years.  Next year, there will be a new Model Y (not facelift), so we can expect similar improvements as those of the Model 3.",33

164,2024-09-24,"I posted this on another discussion forum last week in response to someone who claimed EVs just ""move the tailpipe emissions"", but I'll share it here.

Coming home from Minnesota, I stopped to charge in Osage Beach, MO, right in the heart of AECI's territory. I know them, because I often pull up¬†[Electricity Maps](https://app.electricitymaps.com/map)¬†to see how things are progressing (just in the last year, I've noticed CAISO has brought their generation emissions down substantially, remaining mostly ""green"" throughout the day), and AECI is usually a dark spot in the middle of the country due to their high reliance on coal generation.  
  
That got me thinking: how ""dirty"" is charging my car in central Missouri when coal plants are belching out their maximum output and the region's grid is averaging 750g/kWh of CO2?  
  
I did some quick back-of-the-napkin math and found that my old ICE would put out about 9000g of CO2 for every 25 miles I drove. My Tesla? Assuming it consumes 6.25kW to go the same 25 miles, then at 750g/kWh, that's 4600g of CO2 -- half of my old car's emissions.  
  
And that's in one of the dirtier regions of the country. When I charge overnight at home (in the SPP region) where wind makes up \~65% of generation and the carbon intensity of our generation mix is 250g/kWh, that's 1500g of CO2 per 25 miles, or like 17% of the emissions of my old ICE. If I were to charge my car in Seattle, which has a yearly average of 24g/kWh of CO2 emissions thanks to their heavy use of hydropower, I'd be generating 150g of CO2 to drive 25 miles.  
  
I'm not just ""moving"" the emissions from the tailpipe to a smokestack. Even in a worst-case scenario, I'm cutting them in half, and it just gets better from there. And that's before you factor in all those generator interconnection queues I mentioned above\*, which are nearly exclusively renewable generation sources (few energy investors are finding that it pencils out to build new fossil fuel plants, since renewables are so cost-competitive these days and prices are continuing to fall).

\*Reference to a previous post, where I mentioned that here in the Midwest/Great Plains (in the SPP ISO's footprint), there are 25GW of committed Generator Interconnection Agreements and another 85GW of generation sources under study coming online in the next 6 years. For reference, our entire peak load in our region is 56GW. So enough generation to replace almost 50% of our peak load (and more than 50% of our average load) is coming online this decade, and enough to almost triple our current peak load is either committed or under study.",0

So u/y[hoodoo-operator](https://www.reddit.com/user/hoodoo-operator/) mentions motivated reasoning -- which means that people will adjust their reasoning to the underlying motivation.  If an ICE vehicle makes more economic sense for someone's use case, then they will be additionally susceptible to big oil propaganda saying that ICE isn't so bad. 

People want to believe that what works best for them is the best thing overall, and often convince themselves that it's true.  To use another example, think of a rich person arguing about trickle-down economics, or someone in a mining town arguing for ""clean coal"", or someone who likes red meat arguing that the amount of land/water/energy resources used to support cows is fine.

So the only long-term way to combat motivated reasoning is by changing the grounds of the motivation.  As batteries get better and additional manufactures put out quality vehicles, BEVs continue to expand to cover more use cases.  PHEVs expand the use cases to more people.  As those demands increase, the supply of charging networks and apartments will slowly change to accommodate this as well.  Thus expanding the use cases even more.

It will take time, but it will happen.  When BEVs reach the point where they make sense for a large majority of people we will look back and admit that ICE was as awful as it was.",0

For sure I would hope coal is being replaced because it is very dirty, but I'd rather the coal plant pollute somewhere else than my car pollute where my kids are breathing close by.

> and general under investment in electric utilities

Say what?  I have close ties to them, and this is one thing they are not.  Does the entire grid have the latest tech, no, but there is significant investment and generally the grid is in great shape.  The one area that is lacking is transmission generally and last mile stuff in some areas.  The problem with that has been flat demand for decades and, if adjusted for population, falling demand.  That's because all the advancements have required less power, not more.  Not since the AC have we had something to boost demand and drive the need for more investment.  EVs are that answer, and it's going to give the grid a reason to upgrade a lot of the things that are issues.

> will force the utilities to literally charge more for their KW's

They might charge more for transmission, but it's likely at the same time the generation will fall.  Solar/Wind is incredibly less costly to generate.  The problem is it typically requires new transmission.  Long term, you should see prices go down because the generation infrastructure costs less and transmission is a fixed cost.  More demand allows you to spread that fixed cost out more.

> its not as easy as just buying an EV and suddenly the world is green and sustainable.

No one said it was.  We said EVs are way better than gas cars in this regard.

> but that advantage disappears if you have to charge off of the grid, at night.

At night, you still have all the renewable sources and low demand, so they can use that in most areas.  Battery storage also allows you to shift solar/wind generated during the day to nighttime.  In the future, HVDC lines can even shift solar/wind from areas of the world where it is still daytime to those where it isn't to cover the early nighttime hours with more demand.

It's not. It has nothing to do with shame in most cases. It's entirely the same reasoning that people will insist that whichever moron theirb favorite sports team drafted is the most promising rookie in the league despite all evidence. It's team sports. Liberals and progressives want EVs, therefore conservatives will insist that EVs are the worst thing ever because you can't ever agree with the other team. The propaganda and misinformation comes later, as some people realize that a highly motivated audience is a fantastic natural resource to make money from. 

And in the few cases where it's not that, it's simple fear of change. 

How do you convince people otherwise? You don't, for the most part. If you have people close to you who buy the propaganda, you can shift their opinion by introducing them to your EV and letting them build experience and comfort with it. That sometimes helps, in the same way that traditional approaches to deradicalization require exposure to the subjects of bias.

Sure, the payoff takes time but not THAT long when talking about a commercial entity.",11
11,2024-09-25,"50 kW chargers should not exist.  At this point, the only chargers that should be being built that aren't 250 kW should be at hotels, theme parks, airports, and basically anywhere else where you'd expect to be parked for 8+ hours.

It's not just about location.  Sure, a shopping center that's a few miles from a major interstate highway isn't going to get a lot of road trippers that need fast charging, and so the typical user of that charger won't mind that it takes over an hour to charge since they're gonna be there over an hour anyways.

But it's about the *perception*.  So often, people criticize EVs because you supposedly have to wait for them to charge, and continuing to build slow chargers just feeds into that narrative.  I'm of the opinion that J-1772 never should have existed and actively harmed EV adoption.  The short range and slow charging of the Leaf made it a terrible EV, and so many ICEholes still think EVs go under 100 miles and then take several hours to charge.

Besides, what if you need to charge, can't charge at home, but also don't need to do any shopping, and don't feel like eating out? You're gonna need that fast charging.",0

10,2024-09-25,"Nobody sits down for an hour on a road trip, that's just not realistic.

Today, if you don't have fast chargers, you're not getting traffic. People using level 3 are road tripping and want to keep moving. A 20 minute fast charge is still plenty of time to get a burger and you need that draw nearby to get people to stop at all. There's just not enough chargers out there right now; they're strategically placed to bridge the gaps and get you across long distances, so you really don't have many choices on where to stop. And since you're having to charge up to 80% to make the next gap, it really pays to concentrate business around those fast chargers and capture those stops.

Eventually, instead of a charger every 200 miles, infrastructure will build out to every 100 miles, then every 50 miles, etc. More EVs on the road should keep them busy, but if the next stop is full you can just keep going - you don't have to wait in line at the only option. But that's still predicated on fast charging being available - you won't stop for 50kW if there's 300kW just down the road. People are still driving to a destination.

I think the places you might see 50kW charging come into play are highly populated areas, remote areas and day trip destinations. 

Populated areas - I'm driving around LA with my friends and we want to grab some food but we're not on a strict timetable, so slow charging while we eat lunch might save me having to top up later to get home. I'm going to the mall for an hour, I'm going to Disneyland (even slower, you'll be there all day), etc.

Remote areas - People still like getting out to the woods and mountains and there may not be enough demand to make fast charging profitable, or there may not be enough existing electrical infrastructure to support it. A tiny crossroads town in Wyoming isn't going to see enough traffic to justify a big charger expense if they even have enough power to run it, but if it's the only place to charge for 200 miles, some of the people that HAVE to go through there will stop rather than skip the journey/use alternative transport.

Day trips - I'm picturing little roadside restaurants on PCH or Angeles Crest or Tail of the Dragon - places that already have existing traffic but aren't really on the way to anywhere. They don't need fast charging, but if you're already there with an EV so why not top up while you're taking a break?",-10

The article says he used ""36,482 kWh at $0.08/kWh "" which checks out, that's just about my cost.

Google suggests the model 3 consumes abut 1 kWh per 4.56 miles, so just to check his numbers there, 36,482 \* 4.56 = 166.358, so that's plausible.

Average gas price in the US has been about $3.07 over the past 6 years.   Over 144k miles, the cost for gas would be...

* 30 mpg : $14,736
* 40 mpg : $11,052
* 50 mpg : $8,842

Versus his $4255 to charge and install charger, the savings over 144k miles would be:

* vs 30 mpg: $10,481
* vs 40 mpg: $6,797 
* vs 50 mpg: $4,587

He says he used 36,482 kWh.  Home charging he says cost him $2,772, so at 8 cents per kWh, that accounts for 34,650 kWh.  Leaving him with 1832 kWh he says he used DC charging and that cost him $583 for supercharging.  32 cents per kWh... or he used referral rewards and got free DC charging, or bought at a time when Tesla was offering a period of free charging.

He mentioned charger installation cost $900 on top, and we'll just assume that's average.

Average price of electricity in the US is 16.4 cents currently, or double what he pays, but lets say it was 12 cents over the last 6 years on average (guesstimate).  So home charging for the same kWh would have cost $4377.  Add the $583 for fast charging (assuming the average person would have paid 32 cents per kWH), and the $900 for charger, and over the same period at average electricity prices would have cost $5860 to charge his car.

So at best, using national average electricity pricing, the savings over 144k miles would be:

* $8,876 cheaper to fuel than a 30 mpg car
* $5,192 cheaper than a 40 mpg car
* $2,982 cheaper than a 50 mpg car

And of course he'll see savings on maintenance.

Also, keep in mind that the model 3 is one of the most efficient EVs on the market.  Other EVs will see higher costs for the same mileage.

Versus a PHEV... the savings will be negligible given that most daily miles use residential charging, and given their gas efficiency and the higher cost of DC fast charging, road trip miles cost similar amounts.

The other part is comparing it to the other next gen trucks; the Chevy trucks blow it out of the water in terms of range, and also I believe towing

The salesman I talked to said he loves his, but that they're not moving. At one point last year to clear the last 2023s they put \~$20k on the hood to move them. That'll massively knock down resale value, even before price adjustments come with the Silverado starting to move units",0

This argument kinda sticks out here.

Also Volvo uses nonadjustable head restraints - obviously different seat design there so not quite as a direct comparison as to the Model 3.

Getting the truck for the price I paid in the 50s. I feel like it‚Äôs a very good value for what it offers me. 

I disagree that a full EV platform will make it any better. I actually think it‚Äôll likely make it worse. 


For example, the Silverado EV, which had a full EV platform, cost more, has double the batteries to get further range, and has a silly small frunk. 


Also, I have seen several online efficiency comparisons that show that the lightning is getting the same efficiency as the Silverado. So why spend all of that money to develop a full platform?

My friend who owns a farm asked if I'd be interested in converting their old Massey Ferguson 65 to electric, as they're also big EV fans (I built a portable 1kW solar setup for them as well). I removed the engine and swapped it out for a 20kW brushed DC motor, and I built a 3kWh battery pack using second-hand li-ion cells from Battery Hookup. The motor controller is an Alltrax 400A one, and I designed a custom throttle and electronic clutch pedal situation to make it intuitive for those who are used to driving ICE tractors. This certainly isn't suitable for spending 8 hours a day plowing fields or anything like that, but that wasn't the requirement. We simply wanted to give new life to an old tractor that wasn't being used. It works great for hauling trailers and wagons through the fields while workers harvest tomatoes, pumpkins, etc. 

I'm currently working on a custom screen to display the power consumption, speed, and remaining battery percentage. From my initial tests, it lasts about 2 hours driving around on dirt and gravel, which is perfect for ~90% of the use cases. For the times when this tractor is unsuitable, they can bring out the diesel tractor.

I'm planning to do some more EV conversions in the future. I'd love to do a larger tractor with an enclosed cab and put a Nissan Leaf motor in. I also want to design a better battery because this one was a nightmare to assemble. It all looked fine in CAD but trying to install threaded rods with multiple nuts spaced along them was so tedious and finicky.",0

16,2024-10-09,"I think you're seriously underestimating how much work tractors do. It's not just about hauling heavy equipment from one side of a farm to another, or carrying an attachment 20 miles through a field as it snakes its way around said field. 

Just think of how much energy it takes to plow a field. There's the distance, but then there's the breaking up tons and tons of soil and turning it over. A combine harvester has to pull corn out of the ground, separate it from the husk, then run an auger to feed it into the hauling vehicle that runs beside it. That auger by itself probably uses 20 to 30 hp.

I just looked up the energy consumption of a combine harvester, and apparently they use about 152 megajoules of engine energy per hectare. That equates to about 42 kWh.

The average farm in the US is 187 hectares, so you're talking 7.8 mWh just to run one tractor for one harvest. Even if you shoved 1 mWh of battery into a tractor, that means you'd need easily over 8 battery cycles just for the harvest, which would take *days*. That's not including the plowing (which probably takes the most energy), the planting, the pesticide, dealing with weeds, fertilizer, etc etc.

Batteries are going to either need to get much denser, much easier to charge, or both before they can be used in farming tractors.",-16

It shows a bump in the price of ""cathode material"" in 2022‚Äì2023, now rapidly tapering off in 2024.

So you can pick old I5 with 72kwh battery and upgrade it with new 84kwh battery, already today. I think that in 5-10 years we would be able to buy 100kwh battery for EV6, for around 5k$.

And that's for a Leaf which does not have a battery cooling system, thus not as long a battery life.  Typically 2013+ Leafs have 2% per year degradation on average. The misinformation that all EV batteries die too soon has a shred of truth to it (like all misinformation).  It came from the earlier Leafs (2011-2012 MY and very early 2013s) that had NMO battery chemistry and in warm climates especially those batteries did die after 3 or 4 years.  But that is not typical of any other ground up EV design, which are all either NMC or LFP chemistry and have battery cooling.  The typical degradation for those is only 1% a year, meaning the batteries are good for 100s of thousands of miles and outlast the cars they are in.

Can someone remind me how many vehicles started production in 2023 or earlier and still have a reservation list? Maybe the Tesla Semi?

If you include cars that aren't yet in production then you can add the R2S and Aptera and I'm sure a few supercars.

If the foundation series is anything to go by, Tesla is manufacturing the Cybertrucks in various configurations and releasing the invites to make sure everything that they have produced is sold. So there is probably some combination of options where they have produced sufficient to meet demand, but most who are configuring today will still need to wait a while.

4 years ago we got a 2008 cayenne at copart with 114k. It was totalled for vandalism, was keyed outside, inaide was slashed.  Got it for 4200 after fees.  Got a replacement interior from ebay for 800, left outside alone, she did not care.

I fixed the hunting idle, valve cover, pcv, plastic lines... 

I did all the mechanical repairs, nothing was porsche specific, plugs, coils, brakes, suspension, all run of the mill.

It JUST hit 200k, got rear-ended, its going back to copart, (hahahh) and we are getting a check for 6000....

Replacing soft close door actuators costs about $1K per door including parts and labor and they tend to fail also around 60K miles. Luxury cars can also have random things fail at any time like seat railings, cooled seat fans, clock springs, seatbelt butler, dashboard leather warping, etc. 

These EVs will likely be less expensive because performance-oriented engines and transmissions are needier than electric motors and batteries. But there's still plenty of money to spend outside of engine components. I'd say only 30% of ongoing luxury car maintenance costs are engine- and transmission-related.

> Ford CEO Jim Farley says he doesn't want to give up the Xiaomi Speed Ultra 7 he's been driving for the past half year.

> ""I don't like talking about the competition so much, but I drive the Xiaomi,"" Farley said while speaking to the British presenter Robert Llewellyn on ""The Fully Charged Podcast."" The podcast, which Llewellyn hosts, aired on Monday.

> ""We flew one from Shanghai to Chicago, and I've been driving it for six months now, and I don't want to give it up,"" Farley continued.

> The SU7 is Xiaomi's maiden electric vehicle. The Chinese tech giant produces three versions of the car: SU7, SU7 Pro, and SU7 Max. Farley didn't specify which version he was driving.

> ""It's fantastic. They sell 10,000, 20,000 a month. They're sold out for six months,"" Farley said of Xiaomi's success with the SU7 earlier in the interview.

> ""You know, that is an industry juggernaut and a consumer brand that is much stronger than car companies,"" he added.

> Representatives for Farley at Ford didn't respond to a request for comment from Business Insider sent outside regular business hours.

> The popularity of the SU7 has come at a cost for Xiaomi. When Xiaomi reported its second-quarter earnings on August 21, its EV branch posted an adjusted loss of $252 million.

> That means Xiaomi lost about $9,200 for each of the 27,307 SU7s it shipped that quarter. The SU7 is sold at a base price of 215,900 yuan, or about $30,000, and is available only in China.

> A spokesperson for Xiaomi told BI's Matthew Loh in August that the company was looking to lower its production costs by increasing the scale of its EV arm.

> ""In addition, Xiaomi's first EV is a pure electric sedan, and its investment cost is relatively high, so it will take some time to digest this part of the cost,"" the spokesperson told Loh.

> These aren't the first comments Farley or his fellow Ford executives have made about the scale or progress of China's EV industry.

> After visiting China in May, Farley told a Ford board member that China's auto industry was an ""existential threat,"" The Wall Street Journal reported in September.

> In early 2023, Farley and his chief financial officer, John Lawler, were in China when they tested out an electric SUV made by the state-owned automaker Changan Automobile, the Journal reported.

> The report said the pair was impressed by the quality of the Chinese-made EVs.

> ""Jim, this is nothing like before,"" Lawler told Farley, according to the Journal. ""These guys are ahead of us.""

> Farley's comments have come as Chinese automakers continue to dominate the global EV market. Data compiled by the technology firm ABI Research for Business Insider shows Chinese automakers accounted for 88% of the EV market in Brazil and 70% in Thailand in the first quarter of this year.

> Competing with rivals such as Xiaomi will be critical for Ford as it formulates its approach to the EV market.

> Ford posted a big earnings miss in the second quarter of the year, sending the company's stock tumbling. The company's earnings per share came in at $0.47, below analyst estimates of $0.68. Its profitability for the quarter was weighed down by its EV segment, which saw a $1.14 billion loss amid slowing demand. Ford's third-quarter earnings are due on October 28.

> In August, Lawler told reporters that Ford was changing its EV strategy and would replace its planned electric SUVs with hybrid models instead. The move is set to cost Ford nearly $2 billion.

> Ford shares are down nearly 9% year to date.",0

If you are fully vertically integrated you control your entire supply chain but that also means you need to to the R&D for EVERY SINGLE STEP of your supply chain yourself.

if you need a new part for something you need to build your own production for that part while also keeping your other production running.

If you have any quality problems you cant simply reject a part and its not your problem anymore, you already paid for that part.  
If theres a problem anywhere in your own production you will run out of parts because you are the only one making your parts.

These things are not a problem if you buy from suppliers, they do the R&D and will compete with each other, if they deliver bad quality you reject the parts, if they cant deliver you simply buy stuff from other suppliers or you already have multiple sources going anyways.

I don't think people realise just how vertically integrated BYD is.

My Seal has ""BYD Design"" written on the side of the car since their design is in-house (where older manufacturers might have ""Gaia"" or another design house somewhere if displayed at all). 

he lights all have little ""BYD Tech"" stamps in them.

BYD produce half of the iPads in the world so they'll have access to LCD display, so there's the two displays covered by their already existing processes.

Semi conductors? Their engineering division produces those.

They have massive engineering operations that produce motors, so throw two of those in there for good measure.

Batteries? They go as far as to have shares in mining operations.

Even elements that aren't by BYD in-house have managed to be smart about cost savings. Instead of doing what Tesla, HMG or VW et al. do and dedicate a vast team to custom operating software, they just slap a skin on a flavour of Android for the infotainment and you're done.

I also wouldn't be surprised if there was an insane degree of automation at their factories, too. I took my Seal to my uncle, who's retired but had worked on quality control lines at Nissan since the 80s, so he knows how to put together a good car and what a good car looks like. Other than a piece of decorative plastic under the bonnet not being clipped in he couldn't find any issues with shut lines, panel gaps and trim; the only way they could be *that* even and consistent all around the car is if it was all done by a modern high-precision robot.

11,2024-10-25,"Sure, if you directly transfer the full heat you'll damage other components. But that is why you have valves, so you can either regulate flow or mix different coolant streams. One of the problems of the not fully integrated cooling system is that we only get one cooling fan speed, which is mainly defined by the motor

Some of the missed chances due to the separated setup could be e.g.
- in cold conditions one could use the remaining motor heat to heat up the battery after parking, so the next heating cycle of the cabin will go quicker and with less thermal effort (more comfort and range)
- in cold conditions in electric mode, one could use the motor block as a heat source for the heat pump during heat-up to avoid the issues correlated with evaporator icing (more comfort and range due to avoidance if de-icing)
- in hot conditions, the electronics cooling of the electric refrigeration compressor could be done by one of the water cycles to reduce the load on the a/c cycle yielding in more efficient cooling (more range)
- a/c integration in the turbocharger cooling for additional power (more performance)

In the end, on single component level prices stay lower if no integration happens and as long as the departments don't get a combined KPI to meet, the managers will only harm themselves by loss of salary or power for cooperating, which also transfers to the target setting for their staff.

IMO this is why from time to time it needs new companies to do it differently (see tesla with their TMS in Model Y).

8,2024-10-25,"You said 

> It's cheaper because billions in government aid allowed it to be vertically integrated, that's about it.

That's not 'about it'...far from it. 

People still just do not grasp how big and how capable BYD actually is and instead just want to dumb it down to basic 'govt subsidies, slave labour, IP theft'. This collective sticking of heads in the sand and trying to just brush them aside as a 2-bit Chinese manufacturer is how they will continue to pull ahead. 

BYD employ over 290,000 staff globally, of which 11,000 are graduate researchers and scientists specifically for R&D. 

This R&D team continuously improves EVERYTHING, from battery chemistry, manufacturing processes, robotics, materials composition, cabin acoustics, structual rigidity, off road capacilities, electrical engineering, software engineering, etc. etc. 

BYD are not just an EV maker, they are a conglomerate and in fact are one of the worlds largest electronics contract manufacturers. 

They still make mobile phone/tablet batteries and better yet, have been providing contract manufacturing for global brands for years. 

Did you know that BYD is one of Apples contract manufacturers for their iPads alongside Foxconn? 20% of the worlds iPads are wholly manufactured by BYD. 

Remember when it came out in the news that Apple was moving manufacturing out of China to places like Vietnam? You know what they actually did? Took 20% of their iPad manufacturing from Foxconn and gave it to BYD to make out of their electronics manufacturing plant in Vietnam!

If you have a Apple Ipad with 'Made in Vietnam' on the back...it was made by BYD. 

If BYD have the ability to make iPads to the quality and standard that Apple require, what do you think the electronics in their cars is going to be like?

When you compare the big picture of BYD and their R&D, to R&D teams from all other makers it is pretty clear how BYD can now do things better and cheaper. 

Most other makers still outsource R&D of individual parts to external parts makers (ie. Bosch, ZF, Bilsten, Brembo, etc.). This increases costs, increases time to market and makes manufacturing difficult as its the manufacturers job to make eveything from all these makers fit together. 

BYD doesn't have this problem, that is the true benefit of BYD's vertical integration brings to the table for them. 

Ford, GM and everyone else can barely make a profitable EV. Meanwhile BYD has the in-house capability to make not just make a profitable EV, but also a whole friggin iPad!",-8

We use systems like this extensively here in Norway, but mostly for Ferries.    

Can you imagine the power lines needed for an 8.5MW charger?    

When the charger is in use maybe 7 or 8 minutes every 20 or 30 minutes, it just makes sense to put down a huge battery bank.  Instead of a massive disturbance in the grid every time a ferry hooks up and starts pulling [8.MW](http://8.MW), it can instead pull 1 or 2MW continuously.   

Actually, I think we only have one route with 8.5MW chargers, and I don't know the schedule there.  20 minutes is the time between each ferry on the route I use most often.    

We have a few battery-buffered charging stations for cars, too. and on the one I've used there's a placard stating that if demand results in an empty battery charging speed will drop significantly. That one is a bit 'out there' and it just costs too much to upgrade the grid all the way there.",0

23,2024-10-25,"Let me explain by way of analogy.

You have a garden hose. It can deliver some water all the time, but it's no match for a fire hose (which can deliver **a ton** of water all the time). But without upgrading your plumbing and buying a new fire hose you have what you have -- the garden hose.

Now imagine you have this garden hose filling up let's say a 55 gallon drum. It won't be able to fill it immediately, but given enough time the garden hose will get the job done. You'll have 55 gallons of water available immediately!  (Plus whatever the garden hose can refill.)

**OH SHIT THERE'S A FIRE!!** You grab the 55 gallons and dump it all in one swoop! Puts out the majority of the fire, but there's still a few hot spots that you can easily address by pointing the garden hose at the hot spots.

Now that the fire is out, you put the garden hose back so that it starts filling up that 55 gallon drum again.

-------

So in this analogy, ""the fire"" is the massive inrush that happens when you first plug in a DCFC car. (Go look up ""charge curve"" for your favorite car and you'll see they all start out charging like crazy, then taper off quite a bit as the battery fills up.) The 55 gallon drum is the battery buffer -- a temporary place to store electricity so that you can satisfy that insane startup curve on most cars. And the garden hose is the existing electrical service -- functional but incapable of providing huge bursts of electricity.

This is really a stopgap solution until the electrical service (the garden hose) can be upgraded. That's a costly and slow process (which is mentioned in the article), and for a lot of locations if you have a large enough battery buffer may not even be necessary. Eventually it likely will be necessary, but that's a five/ten years down the road problem, and one you can solve by getting the process rolling *now* and using the battery buffer as a band-aid in the meantime.",0

15,2024-10-25,"Sorry for formatting as I'm on Mobile

A big cost of running electric chargers is actually the demand charge. My utility is currently at $2.67 per kw over 100kw with plans to increase that to $6.52 by 2030. So what does this mean? Well let's take a hypothetical scenario where they meet US NEVI program requirements with a total station power minimum of 600kw shared by a requirement minimum of 4 ports, a maxed out station would yield them an extra $1,335 Bill on top of actual usage and daily connection charges using 2024 rates. 2030 rates for demand charges alone would be $3,260.

That's where installing battery connected units come into play. You can charge them at a lower rate and use them as a buffer to reduce the peaks of usage saving the company money and reducing the number of years it takes to recoup costs. 

For instance there are dc fast chargers that connect to a standard household or small business 240 volt connection, have a 200+kwh battery inside and can fast charge several cars per day no problem.",0

‚ÄòiSeeCars identified models with a fatal accident rate at least two times higher than the average car, with the five deadliest vehicles over four times the average. The Hyundai Venue, Chevy Corvette, and Mitsubishi Mirage are the three deadliest cars on American roads, based on fatal accidents per mile traveled. The Porsche 911, Honda CR-V Hybrid, Tesla Model Y, Mitsubishi Mirage G4, Buick Encore, Kia Forte, and Buick Envision round out the top 10 deadliest vehicles, with fatal accident rates between 2.8 and 4.9 times the average.‚Äù",0

Give people full torque off the line and even if the 0 to 60 time is the same as an ICE car you can certainly get yourself into trouble. But many EVs have faster 0-60 too.

So if you think all those SUVs are dangerous, wait until they‚Äôre the same thing with a ton more power. Things could get way worse than the high danger we have today. 

I‚Äôve started wondering if some kind of graduated license system for the speed of your car would be a good idea.

169,2024-11-21,"Full translation, I have highlighted the gist of the article:

The management consultancy P3 has analysed data from more than 7,000 electric cars and published findings on real-life battery ageing. Batteries lose performance over time, resulting in less range and, in the long term, energy storage that can no longer be used in practice. However, the mass failure of electric car batteries after just a few years predicted by some has not materialised.

The battery is the most expensive component in an electric car, which justifies concerns about its long-term durability. After all, a defect or severely reduced performance can result in high costs for owners - either through repairs, replacement of the battery or in the form of a reduced residual value of the vehicle. To find out the actual risks, the e-mobility specialists at P3 conducted a study.

‚ÄòMisinformation can have a negative impact on the transition to electromobility by increasing unfounded fears and thus reducing the social acceptance and market penetration of electric vehicles. Therefore, the provision of reliable and transparent data is crucial in order to convey a realistic picture of the actual battery life and thus strengthen confidence in electric vehicles,‚Äô say the consultants. In the first step, they analysed 50 electric cars from P3's own fleet, followed by real measurement data from 7,000 electric cars. They were supported by the battery diagnostics start-up Aviloo.

**The key results: In the first 30,000 kilometres or so, capacity loss is accelerated and the so-called State of Health (SoH) drops relatively quickly from 100 to around 95 percent. The real degradation decreases with increasing kilometre mileage. According to the Electrive portal, the Aviloo data from the 7,000 vehicles showed an (average) SoH of around 90 per cent at 100,000 kilometres. After that, the trend line is almost horizontal, between 200,000 and 300,000 kilometres it is almost stable - and is well above the 70 to 80 percent from the battery warranty. In fact, it is closer to 87 per cent.**

The data from the 50 P3 vehicles matches the results from the Aviloo analysis. ‚ÄòAlmost all of the P3 vehicles tested have an SoH of over 90 per cent. This indicates that the batteries in the P3 fleet continue to maintain very good performance despite different manufacturers, different usage profiles and intensive use,‚Äô it says.

P3 points out that the data available for vehicles with a mileage of over 200,000 kilometres is significantly smaller than for vehicles with a lower mileage. ‚ÄòThe reason is that there are only a few vehicles with such a long range. This limits the significance of high mileages somewhat and also leads to a greater scattering of data,‚Äô says the study.

To allay customers' concerns about electric cars, manufacturers offer extensive warranties on traction batteries. Up to eight years or 160,000 kilometres are common, usually with a guarantee of over 70 to 80 percent remaining storage capacity. The influence of the battery condition on the residual value of a car when it is sold is particularly important for owners. ‚ÄòWithin the warranty period, the loss in value is heavily dependent on ageing and the remaining capacity,‚Äô explains P3. ‚ÄòAfter the warranty expires, a greater loss in value is to be expected.‚Äô",-169
125,2024-11-22,"I don't think this study is really news.  Graphs showing 5% degradation over the first two years and then a very slow straight line have been around for a while.  Statistics from Tesla owners in Belgium and the Netherlands (loads of Tesla taxis) showed similar results.  They found that after 500,000 miles/8000,000 km, a Tesla owner could expect a range of around 80% of the range when new.

The stuff about batteries need to be replaced after 5 years is FUD from the oil industry, which has been repeated by people with agendas but no experience or knowledge of EVs.  It's a similar story with fires. Initial reports from the Stavanger airport car park fire were that the fire was caused by an EV, whereas, it was actually caused by a diesel Opel Zafira.

This stuff is the near future. For example, Australia is currently putting in regulations to allow EVs to feed back into the grid.

The issue of energy density isn't really a problem at this point, for the vast majority of use cases. Unless you are driving away from infrastructure for a significant distance or trying to drive for many hours at a time non-stop, EVs right now have no real disadvantages in terms of fuelling when compared to ICE cars, with a small amount of planning.

It's also worth noting that governments everywhere are always influencing markets. Cynically this is often for private benefit, but is also used for the good of their people. Providing funding, tax breaks and low interest loans to businesses to employ their people is one way this is done, and introducing regulations to make it mandatory for companies to behave in a certain way to gain access to their market, and the profits that go along with that access.

It's basically the same reason why when you log in to Google, you need to know that the web server you're talking to has a real certificate belonging to `google.com` and not an impostor.

7,2024-12-11,"My utility charges ~$0.25/kWh. My solar, installed, was about $0.065/kWh. I can't sell it back to the utility, but I get practically infinite banking (though they charge a ~$20/mo fee for having solar). That works out to roughly $0.08/kWh for my solar. And it could be even less, and I can get 2:1 banking in some cases (1kWh out can equal 2kWh in)

So assuming my solar costs $0.08/kWh, my R1S costs about $0.035/mi to drive. With gas currently at $2.75/gal, it's equivalent cost to driving an ICE that does ~78MPG, and that's for a full size SUV.

Classic ""President might run the executive, but Congress runs the purse strings and on choosing so does it on very tigh leash"". We can't order executive directly to choose A over B.

Part of me wants to spend the extra for another ev charger that is fed directly from the panels so I am literally running my car on sunshine but the sensible part of me knows that all electrons are fungible and that doesn't actually matter whether they come from the panels or the grid, the panels offset the amount used from the aforementioned grid.",17

The amount I drive, I was spending on average about $266/month on gas alone. Now with an ev I am spending about $190/month and that includes money spent on DC charging when on roadtrips. Without the DC charging I am spending literally half ($130/month) of what gas was costing me.",0

There are many school districts where the buses are owned and maintained by the school district themselves and are a part of their maintenance and capital budgets. I say this having been an employee in a district where this was the case. 

You are correct that generally there is a structured bidding process in place in many places but again that can be very location dependent. In some places the state has more say in others those things are left up to more local governance.

The district I was in for example owned and maintained all the buses for the district and only contracted out for the operators. While in the next district over, all the buses were owned and operated by private contract companies (basically individual residents that were owner/operators).

I also wouldn‚Äôt want my solar setup chosen by some cheap builder, that‚Äôs something I‚Äôd want to choose myself. 

Mandatory low flow shower heads are annoying but you have to buy shower heads anyway. That‚Äôs not really an added cost. 

Mandatory EV charging in this context is extremely easy and cheap to add, potentially 1 or 2 orders of magnitude less expensive than the solar. And it‚Äôs probably far more impactful than either solar or shower heads. Lack of charging for renters is such an impediment for EV adoption, and the ROI to either the resident or landlord will be much more than the input cost. This is also wayyy easier to do during construction than after. 

Also, housing costs in the Bay Area are largely land-driven. Like, by far. Shower heads and EV chargers are not going to move the needle on that. Solar probably does hurt though.

We have a similar requirement locally, and you really ended up in a stupid position fairly often.

You want to modify a parking spot (add a fence, change the curb/landscaping layout, etc) and boom, now you need to have EV chargers on some of those spots.

But those spots are the furthest out from the facility!  Running a conduit out to it will cut across the entire parking lot.  Meaning you need a permit on all of them, and have to update it to all of them.

So, a $15k change to a few parking spots 200' out from the building just to help traffic flow has now cascaded into a $220k cavalcade of shit.

This law is mostly for apartment type multifamily.

I personally think new builds should prep the parking for later charger install. This law is basically that. It's a design requirement. Like pipes for water and sewage. Or insulation in the walls. Smoke detectors. As for prep the conduit run is important. Existing builds you have to trench asphalt, repave, tear into walls, concrete walls, and upgrade all kinds of electrical. 

Basically it's a change to the minimum requirements. It's a small change now for a big payoff later. Planning and preparedness is always good.

Laws and codes are a hot mess all over the country. But sometimes you can't stable a wire to studs because there are no studs. You must use conduit. What amounts to extension cord is frowned upon.

Because eliminating natural gas requires a lot of solar + battery backup. And even then you'd end up paying for a fair bit of electricity unless you oversize your system.

6. Car locks when you get close to it (good) but doesn't lock when you walk away from it (bad)


7. If you use utility mode, the software blocks out the ""lock"" button on the key fob. The best workaround is to roll down the window, get out of the car, reach in and lock it using the button inside, roll up the window, and pull your arm out before it gets stuck. I'm not a fan of Elon for a lot of reasons, but if one of his cars had such a goofy procedure he'd get the engineers to fix it ASAP.

I mean, comparing any other EV manufacturer to Tesla h2h is brain dead behavior imo. Tesla pioneered the EV path and has its own unique identity that I‚Äôd be hard pressed to compare with any other auto manufacturer, EV, ICE, or any other established brand. So no, I don‚Äôt see how anyone can say that Hyundai is becoming the new Tesla.

What Hyundai is doing may very well propel them past Tesla in vehicle qualities such as reliability, performance, aesthetics, etc which may lead to them overtaking the majority of market shares, but that does not automatically seat them next to Tesla unless Hyundai does something so undeniably revolutionary that the entire industry is forced to acknowledge & adopt it. If they somehow made hydrogen-fueled vehicles viable to the masses and produced on a global scale or made a breakthrough that significantly enhanced the EV battery/drivetrain/fuel economy/performance, then I could see them being coined the ‚ÄúNew Tesla‚Äù.

I‚Äôve been in Korea at ground zero for years witnessing amazing things come out of the Korean automotive market and would recommend many of their products to anyone, but there‚Äôs a difference between being great at what you do and being the pioneer of the next big thing. Hyundai has come a long way and is now one of the hottest names making waves rn, but Tesla is simply Tesla. Always has been and always will be.

The J1772 standard was designed back in the 1990s when people were only thinking about residences.  Thus the spec allows up to 240 volts.  

In a commercial setting, that means you need a transformer to step the 480v 3 phase power delivered from the utility down to something less than 240 volts (usually 208 volts is simplest).  

NACS however allows up to 277 volts.  That's important because when you have 480v 3 phase, any of the 3 legs against ground gives you 277 volts.  That means you don't need a transformer at all, just basic switchgear (circuit breakers and the like).  This dramatically reduces the cost of large scale level 2 charging systems.",0

25,2024-12-23,"Strangely, I never had an issue with the wipers activating on dry days or failing to activate on wet days, which seems to be the most reported problems with Tesla auto wipers.

Instead, my problem is that in Vancouver rain, the speed that the system picks is almost always too slow for comfort. It'll pick speed 1 when it really should pick speed 3, thus waiting far too long between each wipe (which is very dangerous). It made the auto system basically worthless for me.

And before 2020, there was no safe way to manually toggle wiper speed - you had to press the stalk button to bring up a popup touch control, which was located on the bottom left of the screen, like WTF. Why couldn't they have the control pop up closer to the speedometer, where it'd be much safer to operate?

In 2020, they added voice commands to toggle wiper speed - but that would only work if you had an LTE signal. And conveniently, my Model 3 would always take 5+ minutes to reconnect to LTE after driving out of my underground parking garage with no signal. It got to the point where I habitually turned on my phone hotspot every time I got back inside my car, because I could at least trust my phone to reconnect within milliseconds of leaving the garage.

Finally in summer 2023, Tesla delivered a long overdue update that allowed you to use the left scroll wheel to toggle the wiper speed after pressing the stalk button - a feature I'd asked for on r/teslamotors since the day I bought the car in 2019. It's astounding how it took them SIX years (first production Model 3s were sold in 2017) to come up with this basic feature, because clearly streaming apps and light shows and video games were higher priorities.

165,2024-12-30,"I'm in KY, a bit rural, south of Louisville. I'm an outlier for sure in my area in F150 Lightning. 

 Funny thing is, I'm a conservative. Even a deacon in our small town Baptist church! I also work for our local electric company. First on power lines for 17 years and now I am in our control center managing power distribution across the state so I'm uniquely qaulified to assess the fears of grid capacity.  (It's fine, BTW)

I'm exhausted defensing my position on EV's on every front. Church, neighbors, friends and even (especially) co-workers. We make our money selling electricity for goodness sake! 

 One especially memorable conversation was with an old farmer in church. He said ""I didn't realize you were a tree hugging liberal!"" Jokingly, but kinda serious. ""You know you're still burning coal to fuel that truck, right?"" I was like "" You know where I work, right?"" I then proceeded to tell him that even if our local utility burns coal, I get the equivalent of 60-75 Mpg and my cost to charge at home is only about $40/month to drive about 1200 miles per month. 

 My favorite thing to do is let the skeptics just drive it. I tell them to floor it. They're always blown away by the power, smoothness, and build quality. I always include the benefits of no downtime or costs for the typical maintenance of an ICE vehicle.

 We then talk about the particulars of range and chargers and whether it can tow like a big diesel etc etc.... Typical stuff. I always end up telling them my typical use-case scenario (30-50 miles a day with some 200 mile long trips a couple times a month) and how EVERY vehicle has to be weighed out with all it's particulars and your own personal needs. Why would you buy a Jetta when you need to haul firewood? 

 Anyway, we're past the point of the early, enthusiastic adopters. Now we're in the ""easy adopters"" stage. People who can have 2 or 3 vehicles and keep their long range gas or diesel vehicle to assuage their range anxiety. We're gonna see more resistance at this point as people are now seriously looking down the barrel of an increasingly electric future.

 P.S. I try to end every conversation/argument by clarifying that there is no ""mandate"" to buy an electric automobile. Get what works for you. Try to be open minded and consider that if someone like me, a conservative, Baptist, Christian, blue collar utility worker came to conclusions I did, maybe there's something about EVs that they're missing and to do the research for themselves.

> The intent of the H-1B provisions is to help employers who cannot otherwise obtain needed business skills and abilities from the U.S. workforce ([source](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/immigration/h1b))

Companies have instead used the program to increase the hiring pool to reduce wages, and have a more compliant workforce. They can do this because it‚Äôs really complex to enforce the requirement that there‚Äôs no Americans who would do the job. That‚Äôs a very subjective question.¬†


There are a few possible solutions to this problem:
1) Keep or lower the H1B cap while making the visas a bidding process instead of lottery. To have any shot at actually getting your visa application approved you have to pay very well.

2) Add a high annual fee for each H1B employee. Something like $50k per year would be sufficient to encourage hiring Americans over H1B visas.¬†

3) Have the governement post all roles to their website after simplifying the job requirements (ex. No more bullshit must have X years experience with X language for an entry level role, unnecessary 5 day a week in office requirements, etc) and setting the salary to the 90th percentile of the prevailing wage.

The H-1B visa gives an employer complete control over the employee. If the employee loses the job, they lose their visa and are sent back to their home country. This is why the plutocrats want the H-1B visas. In the program employees can be coerced into working 100-hour weeks for below average pay.

...  
Tesla workers said that many employees let go were more senior engineers with higher compensation and they have been replaced with junior engineers from foreign countries at a lower pay.

Also, Musk has literally argued that there's a shortage of good tech workers... like the ones he let go. This is an **insane** claim from him. 2023 saw layoffs of hundreds of thousands of people in the tech field and it's created an insanely competitive job market where there are fewer jobs than workers for the first time since maybe 2008. Companies like Elon's have laid off good talent and sought out cheaper foreign labor while suggesting that they cannot find any good local talent which is fucking nonsense. Fuck him.",-13
